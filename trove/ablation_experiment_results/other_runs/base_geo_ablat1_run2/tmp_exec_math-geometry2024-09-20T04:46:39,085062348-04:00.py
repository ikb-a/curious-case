# The area of a rectangle is given by the product of its width and height.
# The area of triangle ABC is given by the length of the median, divided by 2.
# The area of triangle DEF is given by the length of the median, divided by 2.
# The area of triangle ECF is given by the length of the median, divided by 2.

# We know that the sum of the areas of the triangles is equal to the area of the rectangle.
# So we can set up the following equation:

# (A + B + E) + (A + D + F) + (C + E + F) = (ABCD)

# We can also use the fact that the area of a triangle is equal to half the base times the height.
# So we can rewrite the equation as:

# 2(A + B + E) + 2(A + D + F) + 2(C + E + F) = 2(ABCD)

# Solving for the area of the rectangle, we get:

# ABCD = (A + B + E) + (A + D + F) + (C + E + F)

# To find the area of the triangle DEF, we can use the formula:

# area = (base * height) / 2

# To find the base of the triangle DEF, we can use the fact that the length of the median is equal to the length of the side times the cosine of the angle between the median and the side.
# So we can set up the following equation:

# base = side * cos(angle)

# Solving for the area of the triangle DEF, we get:

# DEF = (side * cos(angle)) * (height / 2)

# To find the area of the triangle ECF, we can use the same formula:

# ECF = (side * cos(angle)) * (height / 2)

# To find the area of the rectangle, we can add up the areas of the triangles:

# ABCD = (A + B + E) + (A + D + F) + (C + E + F)

# To find the area of the rectangle, we can add
