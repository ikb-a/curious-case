**Question**
In how many ways can we seat 6 people around a round table if Fred and Gwen insist on sitting opposite each other?  (Two seatings are considered equivalent if one is a rotation of the other.)


*REUSE* (WRONG) 3-th **Solution**
```python
n = 6

# Define a list of all possible seatings
all_seatings = itertools.permutations(range(n))

# Get the number of distinct elements in each possible seating
distinct_elements = [len(get_distinct_elements(s)) for s in all_seatings]

# Filter out seatings where Fred and Gwen are not opposite each other
filtered_seatings = [s for s, d in zip(all_seatings, distinct_elements) if d == 2]

# Get the number of distinct elements in each filtered seating
filtered_distinct_elements = [len(get_distinct_elements(s)) for s in filtered_seatings]

# Count the number of seatings with Fred and Gwen opposite each other
count = sum(filtered_distinct_elements)
