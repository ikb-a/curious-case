Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$ Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$.

What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nWe are given that $N\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $N\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$.  We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer.

This can be expressed as:\n\\[\nN \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8}\n\\]\n\nStep 3: Similarly, when \\( N \\) is divided by 6, the remainder is 3, which can be expressed as:\n\\[\nN \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6}\n\\]\n\nStep 4: We can express \\( N \\) in terms of the first congruence:\n\\[\nN = 8k + 5 \\quad \\text{for some integer } k\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Substitute this expression into the second congruence:\n\\[\n8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6}\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6}\n\\]\nwhich further simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k \\equiv -2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{6}\n\\]\nDividing both sides by 2 gives:\n\\[\nk \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Express \\( k \\) in terms of another integer \\( m \\):\n\\[\nk = 3m + 2 \\quad \\text{for some integer } m\n\\]\n\nStep 7: Substitute back into the expression for \\( N \\):\n\\[\nN = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21\n\\]\n\nStep 8: Now, we need to find values of \\( N \\) that are less than 50:\n\\[\n24m + 21 < 50\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n24m < 29 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad m < \\frac{29}{24} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad m = 0\n\\]\nThus, for \\( m = 0 \\):\n\\[\nN = 21\n\\]\n\nStep 9: Check for \\( m = 1 \\):\n\\[\nN = 24(1) + 21 = 45\n\\]\nSince \\( 45 < 50 \\), this is also a valid solution.\n\nStep 10: The possible values of \\( N \\) are 21 and 45.
