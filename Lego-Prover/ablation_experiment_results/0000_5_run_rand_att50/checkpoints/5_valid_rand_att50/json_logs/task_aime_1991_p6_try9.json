Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$. Solving shows that $\\frac{743}{100} \\le r < \\frac{744}{100}$, so $743\\le 100r < 744$, and $\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us 73 terms.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the possible values of the floor function. Since the floor function can only take integer values, and the terms can differ by at most 1, the values of \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) must be either \\( n \\) or \\( n + 1 \\) for some integer \\( n \\).\n\nStep 3: Calculate the average of the terms. The total sum is given as 546, so the average value of the terms is \\( \\frac{546}{73} \\approx 7.48 \\). This suggests that most terms are likely 7 or 8.\n\nStep 4: Determine the distribution of 7s and 8s. Let \\( x \\) be the number of terms equal to 8. Then, the number of terms equal to 7 is \\( 73 - x \\). The equation becomes:\n\\[\n8x + 7(73 - x) = 546\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\nx + 511 = 546 \\implies x = 35\n\\]\nThus, there are 35 terms equal to 8 and 38 terms equal to 7.\n\nStep 5: Establish bounds for \\( r \\).

As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$.

(For real $x^{}_{}$, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the [[floor function|greatest integer]] less than or equal to $x^{}_{}$.) Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the summation. The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us 73 terms.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the possible values of the floor function. Since the floor function can only take integer values, and the terms can differ by at most 1, the values of \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) must be either \\( n \\) or \\( n + 1 \\) for some integer \\( n \\).\n\nStep 3: Calculate the average of the terms. The total sum is given as 546, so the average value of the terms is \\( \\frac{546}{73} \\approx 7.48 \\). This suggests that most terms are likely 7 or 8.\n\nStep 4: Determine the distribution of 7s and 8s. Let \\( x \\) be the number of terms equal to 8. Then, the number of terms equal to 7 is \\( 73 - x \\). The equation becomes:\n\\[\n8x + 7(73 - x) = 546\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\nx + 511 = 546 \\implies x = 35\n\\]\nThus, there are 35 terms equal to 8 and 38 terms equal to 7.\n\nStep 5: Establish bounds for \\( r \\). The first term that equals 8 occurs when \\( k = 39 \\):\n\\[\n\\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\implies 8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 9\n\\]\nThis leads to:\n\\[\n8 - \\frac{57}{100} \\leq r < 9 - \\frac{57}{100} \\implies \\frac{743}{100} \\leq r < \\frac{744}{100}\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Conclude the proof. Since \\( 743 \\leq 100r < 744 \\), we have:\n\\[\n\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
