Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$.

Thus, we have:\n\\[\n73n + m = 546\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Since \\( m \\) can take values from \\( 0 \\) to \\( 73 \\), we can express \\( m \\) in terms of \\( n \\):\n\\[\nm = 546 - 73n\n\\]\n\nStep 5: The maximum value of \\( m \\) is \\( 73 \\), leading to the inequality:\n\\[\n546 - 73n \\leq 73\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n546 - 73 \\leq 73n \\implies 473 \\leq 73n \\implies n \\geq \\frac{473}{73} \\approx 6.5\n\\]\nThus, \\( n \\geq 7 \\).\n\nStep 6: The minimum value of \\( m \\) is \\( 0 \\), leading to:\n\\[\n546 - 73n \\geq 0 \\implies 546 \\geq 73n \\implies n \\leq \\frac{546}{73} \\approx 7.48\n\\]\nThus, \\( n \\leq 7 \\).\n\nStep 7: Combining the results from Steps 5 and 6, we find \\( n = 7 \\).\n\nStep 8: Substitute \\( n = 7 \\) back into the equation for \\( m \\):\n\\[\nm = 546 - 73 \\cdot 7 = 546 - 511 = 35\n\\]\n\nStep 9: Since \\( m = 35 \\), there are \\( 35 \\) terms where \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\) and \\( 38 \\) terms where \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = 7 \\).\n\nStep 10: The first term where \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\) occurs at \\( k = 57 \\):\n\\[\n8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01\n\\]\nThis leads to:\n\\[\n8 - \\frac{57}{100} \\leq r < 8.01 - \\frac{57}{100}\n\\]\n\\[\n7.43 \\leq r < 7.44\n\\]\n\nStep 11: Multiply through by \\( 100 \\):\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744\n\\]\n\nStep 12: Thus, we conclude that \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
