We can write the equations as $\\frac{c}{3} + 2*\\frac{d}{2}=5$ and $\\frac{d}{3} + 2*\\frac{c}{2}=7$. Solving the equations and we get $c=6$ and $d=3$. Hence $a=2^6=64$ and $b=2^3=8$.

What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nWe are given that $N\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $N\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$.  We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer.

The base case is trivial. Inductive case: when n is 0 it is also trivial. When $n>0$, let $m=2^n$, and we have $3^m - 1 \\equiv 4*m \\pmod{8*m}$. Then there is $k$ where $3^m - 1 = (8*m)*k + 4*m$. Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$ Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$.
