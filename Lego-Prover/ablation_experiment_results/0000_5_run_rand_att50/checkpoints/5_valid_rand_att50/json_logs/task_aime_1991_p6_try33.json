Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$.

The base case is trivial. Inductive case: when n is 0 it is also trivial. When $n>0$, let $m=2^n$, and we have $3^m - 1 \\equiv 4*m \\pmod{8*m}$. Then there is $k$ where $3^m - 1 = (8*m)*k + 4*m$. Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$ Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$.

The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us 73 terms.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the contribution of each term. Since the floor function can only change by 1 when \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) crosses an integer, the values of the terms can either be \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor = n \\). Then, we can express the sum as:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of terms equal to } n \\cdot n + \\text{Number of terms equal to } n + 1 \\cdot (n + 1) = 546.\n\\]\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of terms equal to \\( n \\) and \\( 73 - x \\) be the number of terms equal to \\( n + 1 \\). Thus, we have:\n\\[\nx \\cdot n + (73 - x) \\cdot (n + 1) = 546.\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Simplify the equation:\n\\[\nx \\cdot n + 73 - x \\cdot n - 73 + x = 546 \\implies 73 - x = 546 - 73n \\implies x = 73 - (546 - 73n).\n\\]\nThis gives us:\n\\[\nx = 73n - 473.\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Since \\( x \\) must be non-negative, we have:\n\\[\n73n - 473 \\geq 0 \\implies n \\geq \\frac{473}{73} \\approx 6.5 \\implies n \\geq 7.\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Now, we can find the maximum possible value of \\( n \\). The maximum value of \\( x \\) is 73, which occurs when all terms are equal to \\( n \\). Thus, we can set \\( n + 1 \\) to be the maximum possible value:\n\\[\nx \\cdot n + (73 - x) \\cdot (n + 1) = 546 \\implies 73n + 73 - x = 546 \\implies 73n = 473 + x.\n\\]\n\nStep 7: Since \\( x \\) can be at most 73, we can find the maximum \\( n \\):\n\\[\n73n \\leq 546 \\implies n \\leq 7.5 \\implies n \\leq 7.\n\\]\n\nStep 8: Thus, \\( n = 7 \\) is the only integer solution. Now, we can find the number of terms equal to \\( 8 \\):\n\\[\nx = 73 - (546 - 73 \\cdot 7) = 73 - 35 = 38.\n\\]\n\nStep 9: The first term where \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\) implies:\n\\[\n8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01 \\implies 7.43 \\leq r < 7.44.\n\\]\n\nStep 10: Therefore, multiplying by 100 gives:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744 \\implies \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743.\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
