Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$. Solving shows that $\\frac{743}{100} \\le r < \\frac{744}{100}$, so $743\\le 100r < 744$, and $\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

(For real $x^{}_{}$, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the [[floor function|greatest integer]] less than or equal to $x^{}_{}$.) Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: We need to evaluate the sum of the floor functions from \\( \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{19}{100} \\right\\rfloor \\) to \\( \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{91}{100} \\right\\rfloor \\). There are \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms in this sum.\n\nStep 2: Since the floor function can only change by at most 1 for consecutive values of \\( k \\), the values of \\( \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\right\\rfloor \\) for \\( k = 19, 20, \\ldots, 91 \\) can either be \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( n = \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\). Then, we can express the sum as:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of terms equal to } n \\times n + \\text{Number of terms equal to } n + 1 \\times (n + 1) = 546.\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Let \\( x \\) be the number of terms equal to \\( n + 1 \\). Then, the number of terms equal to \\( n \\) is \\( 73 - x \\). The equation becomes:\n\\[\n(n)(73 - x) + (n + 1)x = 546.\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n73n + x = 546.\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Rearranging gives:\n\\[\nx = 546 - 73n.\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Since \\( x \\) must be non-negative, we have:\n\\[\n546 - 73n \\geq 0 \\implies n \\leq \\frac{546}{73} \\approx 7.48.\n\\]\nThus, \\( n \\) can be at most 7.\n\nStep 7: If \\( n = 7 \\), then:\n\\[\nx = 546 - 73 \\times 7 = 547 - 511 = 35.\n\\]\nThis means there are 35 terms equal to 8 and \\( 73 - 35 = 38 \\) terms equal to 7.\n\nStep 8: The first term that equals 8 is \\( \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\right\\rfloor \\). Therefore, we have:\n\\[\n8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01.\n\\]\n\nStep 9: Solving these inequalities gives:\n\\[\n8 - \\frac{57}{100} \\leq r < 8.01 - \\frac{57}{100} \\implies \\frac{743}{100} \\leq r < \\frac{744}{100}.\n\\]\n\nStep 10: Thus, multiplying by 100 gives:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744.\n\\]\nTherefore, \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
