If $b=0$, $a^2 mod 3 = 0^2 mod 3 = 0$; If $b=1$, $a^2 mod 3 = 1^2 mod 3 = 1$; If $b=2$, $a^2 mod 3 = 2^2 mod 3 = 1$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem\n  fixes a :: int\n  shows \"a^2 mod 3 = 0 \\<or> a^2 mod 3 = 1\"\n```\n\n## Structured informal proof\nStep 1: Introduce a new variable $b$ such that $b = a \\mod 3$.

The base case is trivial. Inductive case: when n is 0 it is also trivial. When $n>0$, let $m=2^n$, and we have $3^m - 1 \\equiv 4*m \\pmod{8*m}$. Then there is $k$ where $3^m - 1 = (8*m)*k + 4*m$. Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$ Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$. Therefore the inductive case holds.
