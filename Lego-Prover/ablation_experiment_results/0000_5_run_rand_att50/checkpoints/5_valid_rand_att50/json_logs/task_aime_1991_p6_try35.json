Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$.

The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us a total of \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that the floor function can yield either \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor + 1 \\), depending on the value of \\( r \\). Since the terms can differ by at most 1, we can denote the number of terms that yield 7 as \\( x \\) and those that yield 8 as \\( y \\).\n\nStep 3: Set up the equations based on the total number of terms and their contributions to the sum:\n- \\( x + y = 73 \\)\n- \\( 7x + 8y = 546 \\)\n\nStep 4: Solve the system of equations. From the first equation, we can express \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\): \\( y = 73 - x \\). Substituting this into the second equation gives:\n\\[\n7x + 8(73 - x) = 546\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\n7x + 584 - 8x = 546 \\implies -x + 584 = 546 \\implies x = 38\n\\]\nThus, \\( y = 73 - 38 = 35 \\).\n\nStep 5: Interpret the results. This means there are 38 terms equal to 7 and 35 terms equal to 8. The first term that equals 8 occurs when \\( k = 57 \\), which implies:\n\\[\n\\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\implies 8 \\leq r + 0.57 < 9\n\\]\nThis leads to:\n\\[\n7.43 \\leq r < 8.43\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Multiply the inequalities by 100 to find \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor \\):\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 843\n\\]\nThus, \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
