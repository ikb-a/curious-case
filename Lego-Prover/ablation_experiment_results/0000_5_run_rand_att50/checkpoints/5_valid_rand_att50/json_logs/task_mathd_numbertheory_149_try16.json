If their teacher puts them in groups of 8, the last group has 5 students. If their teacher instead puts them in groups of 6, the last group has 3 students. What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nWe are given that $N\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $N\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$.  We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer. Thus the 2 solutions less than $50$ are 21 and $21+24(1) = 45$, and their sum is $21+45=66$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50

If their teacher puts them in groups of 8, the last group has 5 students. If their teacher instead puts them in groups of 6, the last group has 3 students. What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Set up the congruences based on the problem statement: \n- From the first condition, we have \\( N \\equiv 5 \\mod 8 \\).\n- From the second condition, we have \\( N \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\).\n\nStep 2: Express \\( N \\) in terms of the first congruence:\n- Let \\( N = 8k + 5 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nStep 3: Substitute \\( N \\) into the second congruence:\n- Substitute into \\( N \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\):\n  \\[\n  8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6\n  \\]\n  Simplifying this gives:\n  \\[\n  2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\implies 2k \\equiv -2 \\equiv 4 \\mod 6\n  \\]\n  Dividing by 2 (noting that 2 and 6 are coprime):\n  \\[\n  k \\equiv 2 \\mod 3\n  \\]\n\nStep 4: Express \\( k \\) in terms of another integer:\n- Let \\( k = 3m + 2 \\) for some integer \\( m \\).\n\nStep 5: Substitute back to find \\( N \\):\n- Substitute \\( k \\) back into the expression for \\( N \\):\n  \\[\n  N = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21\n  \\]\n\nStep 6: Determine the possible values of \\( N \\) under the constraint \\( N < 50 \\):\n- Set up the inequality:\n  \\[\n  24m + 21 < 50 \\implies 24m < 29 \\implies m < \\frac{29}{24} \\implies m \\leq 1\n  \\]\n- Thus, \\( m \\) can be \\( 0 \\) or \\( 1 \\).\n\nStep 7: Calculate the values of \\( N \\):\n- For \\( m = 0 \\):\n  \\[\n  N = 24(0) + 21 = 21\n  \\]\n- For \\( m = 1 \\):\n  \\[\n  N = 24(1) + 21 = 45\n  \\]\n\nStep 8: Sum the possible values of \\( N \\):\n- The possible values of \\( N \\) are \\( 21 \\) and \\( 45 \\).\n- Their sum is:\n  \\[\n  21 + 45 = 66\n  \\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n```\n\n## Proof", "action_agent_ai0": "```isabelle\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_149\n  imports Complex_Main\nbegin\n\n(* formal statement copied from the input *)\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\nproof -\n  (* Step 1: Set up the congruences based on the problem statement. *)\n  let ?S = \"{x::nat. x < 50 \\<and> x mod 8 = 5 \\<and> x mod 6 = 3}\"\n\n  (* Step 2: Express N in terms of the first congruence. *)\n  (* From the first condition: N \u2261 5 (mod 8) implies N = 8k + 5 for some integer k. *)\n  have \"k = (N - 5) div 8\" for N\n    by (metis mod_div_eq)\n\n  (* Step 3: Substitute N into the second congruence. *)\n  (* Substitute into N \u2261 3 (mod 6): *)\n  assume \"N mod 6 = 3\"\n  then have \"8k + 5 mod 6 = 3\"\n    by (metis mod_add)\n\n  (* Step 4: Simplify the congruence: *)\n  (* 8k + 5 \u2261 3 (mod 6) simplifies to 2k + 5 \u2261 3 (mod 6). *)\n  have \"2 * k + 5 mod 6 = 3\" \n    by (metis mod_add)\n\n  (* Step 5: Rearranging gives: 2k \u2261 -2 \u2261 4 (mod 6). *)\n  have \"2 * k mod 6 = 4\"\n    by (metis mod_add)\n\n  (* Step 6: Dividing both sides by 2 gives: k \u2261 2 (mod 3). *)\n  have \"k mod 3 = 2\"\n    by (metis mod_div_eq)\n\n  (* Step 7: Thus we can express k: k = 3m + 2 for some integer m. *)\n  have \"k = 3 * m + 2\" for m\n    by (metis mod_div_eq)\n\n  (* Step 8: Substitute back to find N: N = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 21. *)\n  have \"N = 24 * m + 21\"\n    by (metis algebra_simps(1))\n\n  (* Step 9: Determine possible values of N under the constraint N < 50. *)\n  (* Set up the inequality: 24m + 21 < 50 implies m < 29/24, so m \u2264 1. *)\n  have \"24 * m + 21 < 50 \\<longleftrightarrow> 24 * m < 29 \\<longleftrightarrow> m < 29 / 24\"\n    by (metis field_simps(1))\n\n  (* Step 10: Thus, m can be 0 or 1. *)\n  have \"m = 0 \\<or> m = 1\" by auto\n\n  (* Step 11: Calculate values of N: For m = 0, N = 21 and for m = 1, N = 45. *)\n  have \"N = 21\" when \"m = 0\" \n    by auto\n  have \"N = 45\" when \"m = 1\" \n    by auto\n\n  (* Step 12: Sum the possible values of N: 21 + 45 = 66. *)\n  have \"sum ?S = 21 + 45\" \n    by (metis add.commute)\n\n  (* Conclusion: Conclude the proof. *)\n  thus ?thesis \n    by simp\nqed\n\nend\n```"}}
