Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$ Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$.

Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$. Solving shows that $\\frac{743}{100} \\le r < \\frac{744}{100}$, so $743\\le 100r < 744$, and $\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us 73 terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that since the terms can differ by at most 1, the values of \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) can only be either \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( a = \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\). Then, we can express the sum as:\n\\[\nx \\cdot a + (73 - x) \\cdot (a + 1) = 546\n\\]\nwhere \\( x \\) is the number of terms equal to \\( a + 1 \\).\n\nStep 4: Simplifying the equation gives:\n\\[\nx \\cdot a + (73 - x) \\cdot (a + 1) = 546 \\implies 73a + 73 - x = 546 \\implies 73 - x = 546 - 73a\n\\]\nThus, we have:\n\\[\nx = 73 - (546 - 73a) = 73a - 473\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Since \\( x \\) must be non-negative, we have:\n\\[\n73a - 473 \\geq 0 \\implies a \\geq \\frac{473}{73} \\approx 6.5 \\implies a \\geq 7\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Now, we also need to ensure that \\( x \\) does not exceed 73:\n\\[\n73a - 473 \\leq 73 \\implies 73a \\leq 546 \\implies a \\leq \\frac{546}{73} \\approx 7.48 \\implies a \\leq 7\n\\]\n\nStep 7: Therefore, \\( a = 7 \\). Now substituting back to find \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = 73 \\cdot 7 - 473 = 511 - 473 = 38\n\\]\n\nStep 8: This means there are 38 terms equal to 8 and \\( 73 - 38 = 35 \\) terms equal to 7. The first term where the value is 8 occurs at \\( k = 57 \\):\n\\[\n8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01 \\implies 8 - \\frac{57}{100} \\leq r < 8.01 - \\frac{57}{100}\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n7.43 \\leq r < 7.44\n\\]\n\nStep 9: Multiplying through by 100 gives:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744\n\\]\n\nStep 10: Thus, we conclude that \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Request skills\n### Thoughts 1\nUnderstanding the properties of the floor function and how it interacts with real numbers is crucial for this proof.\n\n### Code 1\n```isabelle\nlemma floor_function_properties:\n  fixes r :: real\n  shows \"floor (r + k / 100) = floor r + (if r + k / 100 - floor r < 1 then 0 else 1)\"\n```\n\n### Thoughts 2\nThe ability to manipulate inequalities and sums is essential, especially when dealing with the constraints on \\( x \\) and \\( a \\).\n\n### Code 2\n```isabelle\nlemma sum_floor_inequality:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us 73 terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that since the terms can differ by at most 1, the values of \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) can only be either \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( a = \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\). Then, we can express the sum as:\n\\[\nx \\cdot a + (73 - x) \\cdot (a + 1) = 546\n\\]\nwhere \\( x \\) is the number of terms equal to \\( a + 1 \\).\n\nStep 4: Simplifying the equation gives:\n\\[\nx \\cdot a + (73 - x) \\cdot (a + 1) = 546 \\implies 73a + 73 - x = 546 \\implies 73 - x = 546 - 73a\n\\]\nThus, we have:\n\\[\nx = 73 - (546 - 73a) = 73a - 473\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Since \\( x \\) must be non-negative, we have:\n\\[\n73a - 473 \\geq 0 \\implies a \\geq \\frac{473}{73} \\approx 6.5 \\implies a \\geq 7\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Now, we also need to ensure that \\( x \\) does not exceed 73:\n\\[\n73a - 473 \\leq 73 \\implies 73a \\leq 546 \\implies a \\leq \\frac{546}{73} \\approx 7.48 \\implies a \\leq 7\n\\]\n\nStep 7: Therefore, \\( a = 7 \\). Now substituting back to find \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = 73 \\cdot 7 - 473 = 511 - 473 = 38\n\\]\n\nStep 8: This means there are 38 terms equal to 8 and \\( 73 - 38 = 35 \\) terms equal to 7. The first term where the value is 8 occurs at \\( k = 57 \\):\n\\[\n8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01 \\implies 8 - \\frac{57}{100} \\leq r < 8.01 - \\frac{57}{100}\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n7.43 \\leq r < 7.44\n\\]\n\nStep 9: Multiplying through by 100 gives:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744\n\\]\n\nStep 10: Thus, we conclude that \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us 73 terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that since the terms can differ by at most 1, the values of \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) can only be either \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( a = \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\). Then, we can express the sum as:\n\\[\nx \\cdot a + (73 - x) \\cdot (a + 1) = 546\n\\]\nwhere \\( x \\) is the number of terms equal to \\( a + 1 \\).\n\nStep 4: Simplifying the equation gives:\n\\[\nx \\cdot a + (73 - x) \\cdot (a + 1) = 546 \\implies 73a + 73 - x = 546 \\implies 73 - x = 546 - 73a\n\\]\nThus, we have:\n\\[\nx = 73 - (546 - 73a) = 73a - 473\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Since \\( x \\) must be non-negative, we have:\n\\[\n73a - 473 \\geq 0 \\implies a \\geq \\frac{473}{73} \\approx 6.5 \\implies a \\geq 7\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Now, we also need to ensure that \\( x \\) does not exceed 73:\n\\[\n73a - 473 \\leq 73 \\implies 73a \\leq 546 \\implies a \\leq \\frac{546}{73} \\approx 7.48 \\implies a \\leq 7\n\\]\n\nStep 7: Therefore, \\( a = 7 \\). Now substituting back to find \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = 73 \\cdot 7 - 473 = 511 - 473 = 38\n\\]\n\nStep 8: This means there are 38 terms equal to 8 and \\( 73 - 38 = 35 \\) terms equal to 7. The first term where the value is 8 occurs at \\( k = 57 \\):\n\\[\n8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01 \\implies 8 - \\frac{57}{100} \\leq r < 8.01 - \\frac{57}{100}\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n7.43 \\leq r < 7.44\n\\]\n\nStep 9: Multiplying through by 100 gives:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744\n\\]\n\nStep 10: Thus, we conclude that \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
