Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$.

The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us 73 terms in total.\n\nStep 2: Since the floor function can only change by at most 1 for consecutive values of \\( k \\), the values of \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) can either be \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( n = \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\). The total number of terms that equal \\( n \\) and \\( n + 1 \\) must satisfy the equation:\n\\[\nx(n) + y(n + 1) = 546\n\\]\nwhere \\( x \\) is the count of terms equal to \\( n \\) and \\( y \\) is the count of terms equal to \\( n + 1 \\). We also know that \\( x + y = 73 \\).\n\nStep 4: From the two equations, we can express \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\):\n\\[\ny = 73 - x\n\\]\nSubstituting this into the first equation gives:\n\\[\nx(n) + (73 - x)(n + 1) = 546\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\nxn + 73n + 73 - xn - x = 546\n\\]\nThis leads to:\n\\[\n73n + 73 - x = 546\n\\]\nThus:\n\\[\nx = 73n + 73 - 546 = 73n - 473\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Since \\( x \\) must be non-negative, we have:\n\\[\n73n - 473 \\geq 0 \\implies n \\geq \\frac{473}{73} \\approx 6.5\n\\]\nThus, \\( n \\geq 7 \\).\n\nStep 6: Now, we can find the maximum possible value of \\( n \\). Since \\( y \\) must also be non-negative:\n\\[\ny = 73 - x = 73 - (73n - 473) = 546 - 73n\n\\]\nSetting \\( 546 - 73n \\geq 0 \\) gives:\n\\[\nn \\leq \\frac{546}{73} \\approx 7.48\n\\]\nThus, \\( n \\leq 7 \\).\n\nStep 7: The only integer value for \\( n \\) that satisfies both inequalities is \\( n = 7 \\).\n\nStep 8: Substitute \\( n = 7 \\) back into the equations to find \\( x \\) and \\( y \\):\n\\[\nx = 73(7) - 473 = 511 - 473 = 38\n\\]\n\\[\ny = 73 - 38 = 35\n\\]\n\nStep 9: The values of \\( k \\) for which \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\) are from \\( k = 57 \\) to \\( k = 91 \\). Thus:\n\\[\n8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01\n\\]\nThis leads to:\n\\[\n7.43 \\leq r < 7.44\n\\]\n\nStep 10: Multiplying through by 100 gives:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744\n\\]\nThus, \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
