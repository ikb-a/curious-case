detail using comments enclosed in \"(*\" and \"*)\".\n- The explanation for each step should be clear and concise, avoiding any unnecessary or apologetic language.\n- You are **strongly encouraged** to create useful and reusable lemmas to solve the problem.\n- The lemmas should be as general as possible (generalizable), and be able to cover a large step in proofs (non-trivial).\n- You **MUST** copy the input lemma EXACTLY: **without changing whitespace**, without paraphrasing, and without adding comments.\nPlease ensure that your proof is well-organized and easy to follow, with each step
