The base case is trivial. Inductive case: when n is 0 it is also trivial. When $n>0$, let $m=2^n$, and we have $3^m - 1 \\equiv 4*m \\pmod{8*m}$. Then there is $k$ where $3^m - 1 = (8*m)*k + 4*m$. Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$ Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$.

We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer.

Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: We start with the congruences given in the problem: \\( N \\equiv 5 \\mod 8 \\) and \\( N \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\).\n\nStep 2: To find values of \\( N \\) that satisfy these congruences, we can express \\( N \\) in terms of the first congruence. Let \\( N = 8k + 5 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nStep 3: Substitute \\( N \\) into the second congruence:\n\\[\n8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6.\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6.\n\\]\nSubtracting 5 from both sides gives:\n\\[\n2k \\equiv -2 \\mod 6 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 2k \\equiv 4 \\mod 6.\n\\]\nDividing both sides by 2 (noting that 2 and 6 are coprime) gives:\n\\[\nk \\equiv 2 \\mod 3.\n\\]\n\nStep 4: We can express \\( k \\) in terms of another integer \\( m \\):\n\\[\nk = 3m + 2.\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Substitute back into the expression for \\( N \\):\n\\[\nN = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21.\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Now we need to find values of \\( N \\) that are less than 50:\n\\[\n24m + 21 < 50 \\implies 24m < 29 \\implies m < \\frac{29}{24} \\implies m \\leq 1.\n\\]\n\nStep 7: The possible values for \\( m \\) are \\( 0 \\) and \\( 1 \\):\n- For \\( m = 0 \\): \\( N = 24(0) + 21 = 21 \\).\n- For \\( m = 1 \\): \\( N = 24(1) + 21 = 45 \\).\n\nStep 8: The valid values of \\( N \\) are \\( 21 \\) and \\( 45 \\). Their sum is:\n\\[\n21 + 45 = 66.\n\\]\n\nStep 9: Therefore, we conclude that the sum of all possible values of \\( N \\) is \\( 66 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n```\n\n## Proof", "action_agent_ai0": "```isabelle\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_149\nimports Complex_Main \nbegin\n\n(* formal statement copy from the input *)\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\nproof -\n  (* Step 1: Define the set of possible values of N based on the given conditions. *)\n  let ?S = \"{x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 = 5 \\<and> x mod 6 = 3}\"\n  \n  (* Step 2: We will first find the values of N that satisfy the congruences. *)\n  (* From the congruences: N \u2261 5 (mod 8) and N \u2261 3 (mod 6) *)\n  \n  (* Step 3: Express N in terms of k from the first congruence: N = 8k + 5. *)\n  have \"N = 8 * k + 5\" for k :: nat\n    by (metis mod_0)\n\n  (* Step 4: Substitute into the second congruence. *)\n  assume \"N mod 6 = 3\"\n  then have \"8k + 5 mod 6 = 3\" \n    by auto\n\n  (* Step 5: Simplifying the congruence, we find: 2k + 5 \u2261 3 (mod 6). *)\n  have \"2 * k + 5 mod 6 = 3\" \n    by (metis add.commute)\n\n  (* Step 6: Rearranging gives: 2k \u2261 -2 (mod 6) or 2k \u2261 4 (mod 6). *)\n  have \"2 * k mod 6 = 4\" \n    by (metis add.commute)\n\n  (* Step 7: Dividing both sides by 2: k \u2261 2 (mod 3). *)\n  have \"k mod 3 = 2\" \n    by (metis 2)\n\n  (* Step 8: Express k in terms of another integer m: k = 3m + 2. *)\n  have \"k = 3 * m + 2\" for m :: nat \n    by (metis add.commute)\n\n  (* Step 9: Substitute back into the expression for N: N = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 21. *)\n  have \"N = 24 * m + 21\" \n    by (metis algebra_simps)\n\n  (* Step 10: Now we find values of N that are less than 50: 24m + 21 < 50. *)\n  have \"24 * m + 21 < 50 \u27f7 m < 1.208333\" \n    by (metis order_le_less_trans)\n\n  (* Step 11: The possible values for m are 0 and 1. *)\n  (* For m = 0: N = 21 and for m = 1: N = 45. *)\n  have \"N = 21\" if \"m = 0\" \n    by (metis algebra_simps)\n  have \"N = 45\" if \"m = 1\" \n    by (metis algebra_simps)\n\n  (* Step 12: The valid values of N are 21 and 45. *)\n  have \"21 + 45 = 66\"\n    by auto\n\n  (* Step 13: Therefore, we conclude that the sum of all possible values of N is 66. *)\n  show ?thesis\n    by (metis sum_nonneg_iff)\nqed\n\nend\n```"}}
