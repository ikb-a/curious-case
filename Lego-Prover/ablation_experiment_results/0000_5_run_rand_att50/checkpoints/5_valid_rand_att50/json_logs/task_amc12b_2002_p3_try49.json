We can rewrite it as \\( (n-2)(n-1) \\).\n\nStep 2: Analyze the factors \\( n-1 \\) and \\( n-2 \\). Since \\( n \\) is a positive integer, both \\( n-1 \\) and \\( n-2 \\) are non-negative integers. \n\nStep 3: Note that one of the factors \\( n-1 \\) or \\( n-2 \\) is odd and the other is even. The product of an even number and any integer is even.\n\nStep 4: The only even prime number is \\( 2 \\). Therefore, we need to find when \\( (n-2)(n-1) = 2 \\).\n\nStep 5: Set up the equations:\n- If \\( n-2 = 1 \\) and \\( n-1 = 2 \\), then \\( n = 3 \\).\n- If \\( n-2 = 2 \\) and \\( n-1 = 1 \\), then \\( n = 4 \\) (not valid since \\( 4-2 = 2 \\) and \\( 4-1 = 3 \\) gives \\( 6 \\), not prime).\n\nStep 6: Check the case \\( n = 3 \\):\n- \\( n^2 - 3n + 2 = 3^2 - 3 \\cdot 3 + 2 = 9 - 9 + 2 = 2 \\), which is prime.\n\nStep 7: Check other positive integers \\( n = 1, 2, 4, 5, \\ldots \\):\n- For \\( n = 1 \\): \\( 1^2 - 3 \\cdot 1 + 2 = 0 \\) (not prime).\n- For \\( n = 2 \\): \\( 2^2 - 3 \\cdot 2 + 2 = 0 \\) (not prime).\n- For \\( n = 4 \\): \\( 4^2 - 3 \\cdot 4 + 2 = 2 \\) (prime).\n- For \\( n = 5 \\): \\( 5^2 - 3 \\cdot 5 + 2 = 2 \\) (prime).\n\nStep 8: Conclude that the only positive integer \\( n \\) for which \\( n^2 - 3n + 2 \\) is prime is \\( n = 3 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem amc12b_2002_p3:\n  fixes n ::nat\n  assumes \"n>0\"\n    and prime:\"prime (n^2+2-3*n)\"\n  shows \"n=3\"\n```\n\n## Proof"}}
