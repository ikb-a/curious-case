Find $m + n$. Show that it is 5. note: this is the type of problem that makes you think symmetry, but actually can be solved easily with substitution, and other normal technniques\n\n## Informal proof\nWe can rewrite $xyz=1$ as $\\frac{1}{z}=xy$. Substituting into one of the given equations, we have $x+xy=5$ $x(1+y)=5$ $\\frac{1}{x}=\\frac{1+y}{5}.$ we can substitute back into $y+\\frac{1}{x}=29$ to obtain $y+\\frac{1+y}{5}=29$ $5y+1+y=145$ $y=24.$ We can then substitute once again to get $x=\\frac15$ $z=\\frac{5}{24}.$ Thus, $z+\\frac1y=\\frac{5}{24}+\\frac{1}{24}=\\frac{1}{4}$, so $m+n=005$.\n\n## Formal statement\ntheorem\n  fixes x y z :: real\n    and p :: rat\n  assumes \"0 < x \\<and> 0 < y \\<and> 0 < z\"\n    and \"x * y * z = 1\"\n    and \"x + 1 / z = 5\"\n    and \"y + 1 / x = 29\"\n    and \"z + 1 / y = p\"\n    and \"0 < p\" \n  shows \"let (m,n) = quotient_of p in m + n = 5\"\n\n## Structured informal proof\nStep 1: Rewrite the equation $xyz = 1$ as $\\frac{1}{z} = xy$.\nStep 2: Substitute the value of $\\frac{1}{z}$ into the equation $x + \\frac{1}{z} = 5$, resulting in $x + xy = 5$ then $x(1 + y) = 5$.\nStep 3: Solve for $\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{1 + y}{5}$.\nStep 4: Substitute the value of $\\frac{1}{x}$ into the equation $y + \\frac{1}{x} = 29$, leading to $y + \\frac{1+y}{5} = 29$.\nStep 5: Solve for $y$, getting $y = 24$.\nStep 6: Substitute the value of $y$ back into the equations to find $x = \\frac{1}{5}$ and $z = \\frac{5}{24}$.\nStep 7: Find $z + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{5}{24} + \\frac{1}{24} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nStep 8: The rational $p = \\frac{1}{4}$ can be expressed as $p = \\frac{m}{n}$ where $m = 1$ and $n = 4$.

The base case is trivial. Inductive case: when n is 0 it is also trivial. When $n>0$, let $m=2^n$, and we have $3^m - 1 \\equiv 4*m \\pmod{8*m}$. Then there is $k$ where $3^m - 1 = (8*m)*k + 4*m$. Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$ Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$.
