Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$.

(For real $x^{}_{}$, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the [[floor function|greatest integer]] less than or equal to $x^{}_{}$.) Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the summation, which is from \\( k = 19 \\) to \\( k = 91 \\). This gives us a total of \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms in the sum.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that the floor function \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) can take on values that are either \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\) depending on the value of \\( r \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( n = \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\). Then, the terms can be expressed as:\n- \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = n \\) for some values of \\( k \\)\n- \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = n + 1 \\) for the remaining values of \\( k \\)\n\nStep 4: Since the total sum is \\( 546 \\), we can express this as:\n\\[\nx(n) + y(n + 1) = 546\n\\]\nwhere \\( x \\) is the count of terms equal to \\( n \\) and \\( y \\) is the count of terms equal to \\( n + 1 \\). We know \\( x + y = 73 \\).\n\nStep 5: Substitute \\( y = 73 - x \\) into the sum equation:\n\\[\nx(n) + (73 - x)(n + 1) = 546\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\nxn + 73n + 73 - xn - x = 546\n\\]\nwhich further simplifies to:\n\\[\n73n + 73 - x = 546\n\\]\nThus, we have:\n\\[\nx = 73n + 73 - 546\n\\]\nor\n\\[\nx = 73n - 473\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Since \\( x \\) must be non-negative, we have:\n\\[\n73n - 473 \\geq 0 \\implies n \\geq \\frac{473}{73} \\approx 6.5\n\\]\nThus, \\( n \\geq 7 \\).\n\nStep 7: Now, we can find the maximum possible value of \\( n \\) by considering the maximum value of \\( y \\):\n\\[\ny = 73 - x = 546 - xn\n\\]\nThis gives us:\n\\[\ny = 73 - (73n - 473) = 546 - 73n\n\\]\nSince \\( y \\) must also be non-negative, we have:\n\\[\n546 - 73n \\geq 0 \\implies n \\leq \\frac{546}{73} \\approx 7.48\n\\]\nThus, \\( n \\leq 7 \\).\n\nStep 8: Therefore, \\( n = 7 \\). Substitute \\( n \\) back into the equation for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = 73(7) - 473 = 511 - 473 = 38\n\\]\nThis means \\( y = 73 - 38 = 35 \\).\n\nStep 9: The values of \\( k \\) for which \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\) are \\( 35 \\) in total. The first \\( 38 \\) terms are \\( 7 \\), and the next \\( 35 \\) terms are \\( 8 \\).\n\nStep 10: The first term where \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\) implies:\n\\[\n8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01\n\\]\nThis leads to:\n\\[\n8 - \\frac{57}{100} \\leq r < 8.01 - \\frac{57}{100}\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\frac{743}{100} \\leq r < \\frac{744}{100}\n\\]\n\nStep 11: Therefore, we conclude that:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744 \\implies \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
