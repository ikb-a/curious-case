The base case is trivial. Inductive case: when n is 0 it is also trivial. When $n>0$, let $m=2^n$, and we have $3^m - 1 \\equiv 4*m \\pmod{8*m}$. Then there is $k$ where $3^m - 1 = (8*m)*k + 4*m$. Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$ Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$.

We have:\n\\[\nn^2 - 3n + 2 = (n - 1)(n - 2).\n\\]\n\nStep 2: Analyze the factors \\( (n - 1) \\) and \\( (n - 2) \\). Since \\( n \\) is a positive integer, both \\( n - 1 \\) and \\( n - 2 \\) are non-negative integers.\n\nStep 3: Note that one of the factors must be even and the other must be odd, since they are consecutive integers. The product \\( (n - 1)(n - 2) \\) must yield an even number.\n\nStep 4: The only even prime number is \\( 2 \\). Therefore, we set up the equation:\n\\[\n(n - 1)(n - 2) = 2.\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Solve the equation \\( (n - 1)(n - 2) = 2 \\). The pairs of factors of \\( 2 \\) are \\( (1, 2) \\) and \\( (2, 1) \\):\n- If \\( n - 1 = 2 \\) and \\( n - 2 = 1 \\), then \\( n = 3 \\).\n- If \\( n - 1 = 1 \\) and \\( n - 2 = 2 \\), this leads to a contradiction since \\( n - 2 \\) cannot be greater than \\( n - 1 \\).\n\nStep 6: Thus, the only solution is \\( n = 3 \\).\n\nStep 7: Verify that \\( n = 3 \\) gives a prime number:\n\\[\n3^2 - 3 \\cdot 3 + 2 = 9 - 9 + 2 = 2,\n\\]\nwhich is indeed prime.\n\nStep 8: Conclude that there is only one positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( n^2 - 3n + 2 \\) is prime, which is \\( n = 3 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem amc12b_2002_p3:\n  fixes n ::nat\n  assumes \"n>0\"\n    and prime:\"prime (n^2+2-3*n)\"\n  shows \"n=3\"\n```\n\n## Proof"}}
