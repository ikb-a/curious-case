We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer.

If their teacher puts them in groups of 8, the last group has 5 students. If their teacher instead puts them in groups of 6, the last group has 3 students. What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Define \\( N \\) such that \\( N \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8} \\) and \\( N \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6} \\). This means we can express \\( N \\) in terms of these congruences.\n\nStep 2: From the first congruence, we can write \\( N = 8k + 5 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nStep 3: Substitute \\( N \\) into the second congruence:\n\\[\n8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6}\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6}\n\\]\nwhich further simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k \\equiv -2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{6}\n\\]\nDividing both sides by 2 gives:\n\\[\nk \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Express \\( k \\) in terms of another integer \\( m \\):\n\\[\nk = 3m + 2\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Substitute back into the expression for \\( N \\):\n\\[\nN = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Now, we need to find values of \\( N \\) such that \\( N < 50 \\):\n\\[\n24m + 21 < 50 \\implies 24m < 29 \\implies m < \\frac{29}{24} \\implies m = 0\n\\]\nThus, for \\( m = 0 \\):\n\\[\nN = 21\n\\]\n\nStep 7: Check the next integer \\( m = 1 \\):\n\\[\nN = 24(1) + 21 = 45\n\\]\nThis is also less than 50.\n\nStep 8: The possible values of \\( N \\) are \\( 21 \\) and \\( 45 \\). \n\nStep 9: Calculate the sum of all possible values:\n\\[\n21 + 45 = 66\n\\]\n\nStep 10: Conclude that the sum of all possible values of \\( N \\) is \\( 66 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n```\n\n## Proof", "action_agent_ai0": "```isabelle\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_149\n  imports Complex_Main\nbegin\n\n(* We are going to find all possible values of N that satisfy the given modular conditions. *)\n\n(* formal statement copy from the input *)\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\nproof -\n  (* Step 1: Define the set of numbers satisfying the conditions. *)\n  let ?S = \"{x::nat. x < 50 \\<and> x mod 8 = 5 \\<and> x mod 6 = 3}\"\n\n  (* Step 2: We know that if x mod 8 = 5, then x can be expressed as x = 8k + 5 for some integer k. *)\n  (* Let's substitute this into the second condition x mod 6 = 3. *)\n  have \"x mod 6 = 3\" implies \"8k + 5 mod 6 = 3\"\n    by (simp add: mod_eq_iff)\n\n  (* Step 3: Simplifying the equation gives us: *)\n  have \"2k + 5 mod 6 = 3\"\n    by (simp add: mod_add)\n\n  (* Step 4: This simplifies to 2k + 5 \u2261 3 (mod 6), hence 2k \u2261 -2 \u2261 4 (mod 6). *)\n  have \"2k \u2261 4 (mod 6)\" \n    by (metis add.commute)\n\n  (* Step 5: Dividing both sides by 2 results in k \u2261 2 (mod 3). *)\n  have \"k \u2261 2 (mod 3)\" \n    by (metis even_iff)\n\n  (* Step 6: Thus, we can express k as k = 3m + 2 for some integer m. *)\n  let ?k = \"3 * m + 2\"\n\n  (* Step 7: Substitute back to find N: *)\n  have \"N = 8(3 * m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21\"\n\n  (* Step 8: We need to find values of N such that N < 50: *)\n  have \"24m + 21 < 50 \\<Longrightarrow> 24m < 29 \\<Longrightarrow> m < 29 / 24\"\n    by simp\n\n  (* The only integer value for m that satisfies this is m = 0. *)\n  then have \"m = 0 \\<Longrightarrow> N = 21\"\n    by auto\n\n  (* Step 9: Check the next integer m = 1: *)\n  have \"m = 1 \\<Longrightarrow> N = 24 * 1 + 21 = 45\"\n    by auto\n\n  (* Step 10: Valid values of N are 21 and 45. *)\n  have \"N = {21, 45}\"\n\n  (* Step 11: Calculate the sum of all possible values of N. *)\n  have \"sum ?S = 21 + 45\"\n    by auto\n\n  (* Conclude that the sum of all possible values of N is 66. *)\n  thus ?thesis by simp\nqed\n\nend\n```"}}
