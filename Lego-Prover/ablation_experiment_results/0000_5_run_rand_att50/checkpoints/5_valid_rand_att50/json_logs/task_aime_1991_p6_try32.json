Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$. Solving shows that $\\frac{743}{100} \\le r < \\frac{744}{100}$, so $743\\le 100r < 744$, and $\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the summation, which is from \\( k = 19 \\) to \\( k = 91 \\). This gives us a total of \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that the floor function \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) can take on values that are either \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\) depending on the value of \\( r \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( n = \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\). Then, we can express the sum as:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=19}^{91} \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = m(n + 1) + (73 - m)n = 546\n\\]\nwhere \\( m \\) is the number of terms that equal \\( n + 1 \\).\n\nStep 4: Rearranging gives us:\n\\[\nm(n + 1) + (73 - m)n = 546 \\implies mn + m + 73n - mn = 546 \\implies m + 73n = 546\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Solve for \\( m \\):\n\\[\nm = 546 - 73n\n\\]\nSince \\( m \\) must be a non-negative integer, we have:\n\\[\n546 - 73n \\geq 0 \\implies n \\leq \\frac{546}{73} \\approx 7.48\n\\]\nThus, \\( n \\) can be at most \\( 7 \\).\n\nStep 6: Substitute \\( n = 7 \\) into the equation for \\( m \\):\n\\[\nm = 546 - 73 \\cdot 7 = 546 - 511 = 35\n\\]\nThis means there are \\( 35 \\) terms equal to \\( 8 \\) and \\( 38 \\) terms equal to \\( 7 \\).\n\nStep 7: The first term that equals \\( 8 \\) occurs when \\( k = 57 \\):\n\\[\n\\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\implies 8 \\leq r + 0.57 < 8.01\n\\]\nThis leads to:\n\\[\n7.43 < r < 7.44\n\\]\n\nStep 8: Multiply through by \\( 100 \\):\n\\[\n743 < 100r < 744\n\\]\nThus, we conclude:\n\\[\n\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
