We can rewrite it as \\( (n-2)(n-1) \\).\n\nStep 2: Analyze the factors \\( (n-2) \\) and \\( (n-1) \\). Since \\( n \\) is a positive integer, both \\( n-1 \\) and \\( n-2 \\) are non-negative integers. \n\nStep 3: Determine the conditions under which the product \\( (n-2)(n-1) \\) can be a prime number. A prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. Therefore, one of the factors must equal 1, and the other must equal the prime number itself.\n\nStep 4: Set \\( n-2 = 1 \\) which gives \\( n = 3 \\). Then, \\( n-1 = 2 \\), and we have \\( (n-2)(n-1) = 1 \\cdot 2 = 2 \\), which is prime.\n\nStep 5: Set \\( n-1 = 1 \\) which gives \\( n = 2 \\). Then, \\( n-2 = 0 \\), and we have \\( (n-2)(n-1) = 0 \\cdot 1 = 0 \\), which is not prime.\n\nStep 6: Since \\( n = 3 \\) is the only positive integer that results in \\( n^2 - 3n + 2 \\) being prime, we conclude that there is exactly one positive integer \\( n \\) for which \\( n^2 - 3n + 2 \\) is prime.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem amc12b_2002_p3:\n  fixes n ::nat\n  assumes \"n>0\"\n    and prime:\"prime (n^2+2-3*n)\"\n  shows \"n=3\"\n```\n\n## Proof"}}
