We can rewrite it as \\( (n-2)(n-1) \\).\n\nStep 2: Analyze the factors \\( n-1 \\) and \\( n-2 \\). Since \\( n \\) is a positive integer, both \\( n-1 \\) and \\( n-2 \\) are non-negative integers. \n\nStep 3: Note that one of the factors \\( (n-1) \\) or \\( (n-2) \\) is odd and the other is even. The product of an even number and any integer is even.\n\nStep 4: The only even prime number is \\( 2 \\). Therefore, we need to find when \\( (n-2)(n-1) = 2 \\).\n\nStep 5: Set up the equations for the cases where the product equals \\( 2 \\):\n- Case 1: \\( n-2 = 1 \\) and \\( n-1 = 2 \\) leads to \\( n = 3 \\).\n- Case 2: \\( n-2 = 2 \\) and \\( n-1 = 1 \\) leads to \\( n = 3 \\) again.\n\nStep 6: Check if there are any other positive integers \\( n \\) that satisfy \\( (n-2)(n-1) = 2 \\). The only pairs of positive integers that multiply to \\( 2 \\) are \\( (1, 2) \\) and \\( (2, 1) \\), both leading to \\( n = 3 \\).\n\nStep 7: Conclude that the only positive integer \\( n \\) for which \\( n^2 - 3n + 2 \\) is prime is \\( n = 3 \\). Thus, the answer is \\( \\mathrm{(B)}\\ \\text{one} \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem amc12b_2002_p3:\n  fixes n ::nat\n  assumes \"n>0\"\n    and prime:\"prime (n^2+2-3*n)\"\n  shows \"n=3\"\n```\n\n## Proof"}}
