Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$. Solving shows that $\\frac{743}{100} \\le r < \\frac{744}{100}$, so $743\\le 100r < 744$, and $\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

The total number of terms in this sequence is \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\).\n\nStep 2: Since the floor function can only change by at most 1 for consecutive values of \\( k \\), the terms in the sequence can only take on two possible values, either \\( \\lfloor r + 0.19 \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r + 0.20 \\rfloor \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( a \\) be the number of terms equal to \\( \\lfloor r + 0.19 \\rfloor \\) and \\( b \\) be the number of terms equal to \\( \\lfloor r + 0.20 \\rfloor \\). We have the equations:\n- \\( a + b = 73 \\)\n- \\( a \\cdot \\lfloor r + 0.19 \\rfloor + b \\cdot \\lfloor r + 0.20 \\rfloor = 546 \\)\n\nStep 4: Since \\( \\lfloor r + 0.19 \\rfloor \\) and \\( \\lfloor r + 0.20 \\rfloor \\) can only differ by 1, we can denote \\( \\lfloor r + 0.19 \\rfloor = n \\) and \\( \\lfloor r + 0.20 \\rfloor = n + 1 \\). Thus, we can rewrite the second equation as:\n\\[ a \\cdot n + b \\cdot (n + 1) = 546 \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ a \\cdot n + b \\cdot n + b = 546 \\]\nor\n\\[ (a + b) \\cdot n + b = 546 \\]\nSubstituting \\( a + b = 73 \\):\n\\[ 73n + b = 546 \\]\nThus, we have:\n\\[ b = 546 - 73n \\]\n\nStep 5: Since \\( b \\) must be non-negative, we have:\n\\[ 546 - 73n \\geq 0 \\]\nThis gives:\n\\[ n \\leq \\frac{546}{73} \\approx 7.48 \\]\nThus, \\( n \\) can take values \\( 7 \\) or \\( 8 \\).\n\nStep 6: If \\( n = 7 \\):\n- Then \\( b = 546 - 73 \\cdot 7 = 547 - 511 = 35 \\)\n- Thus, \\( a = 73 - 35 = 38 \\).\n\nStep 7: If \\( n = 8 \\):\n- Then \\( b = 546 - 73 \\cdot 8 = 546 - 584 = -38 \\), which is not possible.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, \\( n = 7 \\) is the only valid case. This means:\n\\[ \\lfloor r + 0.19 \\rfloor = 7 \\]\n\\[ \\lfloor r + 0.20 \\rfloor = 8 \\]\n\nStep 9: From \\( \\lfloor r + 0.19 \\rfloor = 7 \\), we have:\n\\[ 7 \\leq r + 0.19 < 8 \\]\nThis implies:\n\\[ 6.81 < r < 7.81 \\]\n\nStep 10: From \\( \\lfloor r + 0.20 \\rfloor = 8 \\), we have:\n\\[ 8 \\leq r + 0.20 < 9 \\]\nThis implies:\n\\[ 7.80 < r < 8.80 \\]\n\nStep 11: Combining these inequalities, we find:\n\\[ 7.80 < r < 7.81 \\]\n\nStep 12: To find \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor \\):\n\\[ 780 < 100r < 781 \\]\nThus, \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 780 \\).\n\nStep 13: Since \\( 100r \\) must be an integer, we can conclude:\n\\[ \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

The total number of terms in this sequence is \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\).\n\nStep 2: Since the floor function can only change by at most 1 for consecutive values of \\( k \\), the terms in the sequence can only take on two possible values, either \\( \\lfloor r + 0.19 \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r + 0.20 \\rfloor \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( a \\) be the number of terms equal to \\( \\lfloor r + 0.19 \\rfloor \\) and \\( b \\) be the number of terms equal to \\( \\lfloor r + 0.20 \\rfloor \\). We have the equations:\n- \\( a + b = 73 \\)\n- \\( a \\cdot \\lfloor r + 0.19 \\rfloor + b \\cdot \\lfloor r + 0.20 \\rfloor = 546 \\)\n\nStep 4: Since \\( \\lfloor r + 0.19 \\rfloor \\) and \\( \\lfloor r + 0.20 \\rfloor \\) can only differ by 1, we can denote \\( \\lfloor r + 0.19 \\rfloor = n \\) and \\( \\lfloor r + 0.20 \\rfloor = n + 1 \\). Thus, we can rewrite the second equation as:\n\\[ a \\cdot n + b \\cdot (n + 1) = 546 \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ a \\cdot n + b \\cdot n + b = 546 \\]\nor\n\\[ (a + b) \\cdot n + b = 546 \\]\nSubstituting \\( a + b = 73 \\):\n\\[ 73n + b = 546 \\]\nThus, we have:\n\\[ b = 546 - 73n \\]\n\nStep 5: Since \\( b \\) must be non-negative, we have:\n\\[ 546 - 73n \\geq 0 \\]\nThis gives:\n\\[ n \\leq \\frac{546}{73} \\approx 7.48 \\]\nThus, \\( n \\) can take values \\( 7 \\) or \\( 8 \\).\n\nStep 6: If \\( n = 7 \\):\n- Then \\( b = 546 - 73 \\cdot 7 = 547 - 511 = 35 \\)\n- Thus, \\( a = 73 - 35 = 38 \\).\n\nStep 7: If \\( n = 8 \\):\n- Then \\( b = 546 - 73 \\cdot 8 = 546 - 584 = -38 \\), which is not possible.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, \\( n = 7 \\) is the only valid case.
