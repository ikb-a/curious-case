What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nWe are given that $N\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $N\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$.  We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer.

If their teacher puts them in groups of 8, the last group has 5 students. If their teacher instead puts them in groups of 6, the last group has 3 students. What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: We start with the congruences given in the problem: \\( N \\equiv 5 \\mod 8 \\) and \\( N \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\).\n\nStep 2: From the first congruence, we can express \\( N \\) in the form \\( N = 8k + 5 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nStep 3: Substitute \\( N \\) into the second congruence: \n\\[\n8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6.\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6.\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Rearranging gives:\n\\[\n2k \\equiv -2 \\mod 6 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 2k \\equiv 4 \\mod 6.\n\\]\nDividing through by 2 (noting that 2 is coprime to 6), we have:\n\\[\nk \\equiv 2 \\mod 3.\n\\]\n\nStep 5: This means \\( k \\) can be expressed as \\( k = 3m + 2 \\) for some integer \\( m \\).\n\nStep 6: Substitute back into the expression for \\( N \\):\n\\[\nN = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21.\n\\]\n\nStep 7: We need \\( N < 50 \\), so we solve:\n\\[\n24m + 21 < 50 \\implies 24m < 29 \\implies m < \\frac{29}{24} \\implies m \\leq 1.\n\\]\n\nStep 8: The possible values for \\( m \\) are \\( 0 \\) and \\( 1 \\):\n- For \\( m = 0 \\): \\( N = 21 \\).\n- For \\( m = 1 \\): \\( N = 45 \\).\n\nStep 9: The valid values of \\( N \\) are \\( 21 \\) and \\( 45 \\). Their sum is:\n\\[\n21 + 45 = 66.\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n```\n\n## Proof", "action_agent_ai0": "```isabelle\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_149\n  imports Complex_Main\nbegin\n\n(* Here I will copy the formal statement from the input directly*)\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\nproof -\n  (* Step 1: Define the set of students N based on the given congruences *)\n  let ?S = \"{x::nat. x < 50 \\<and> x mod 8 = 5 \\<and> x mod 6 = 3}\"\n  \n  (* Step 2: Rewrite N based on the first congruence *)\n  have \"N = 8k + 5\" for some integer k (* This follows from the congruence N \u2261 5 mod 8 *)\n  \n  (* Step 3: Substitute into the second congruence *)\n  have \"8k + 5 mod 6 = 3\"\n  proof -\n    have \"8 mod 6 = 2\" by simp\n    thus ?thesis by (simp add: mod_add_eq)\n  qed\n\n  (* Step 4: Simplify the congruence *)\n  have \"2k + 5 mod 6 = 3\" (* Simplifying gives us this congruence *)\n  then have \"2k mod 6 = -2 mod 6\" (* Rearranging yields this *)\n    by (metis add.mod_self)\n  \n  (* Step 5: Further simplify the congruence *)\n  have \"2k mod 6 = 4 mod 6\" (* Which simplifies to this *)\n    by (metis add_diff_eq)\n\n  (* Step 6: Dividing through by 2 *)\n  have \"k mod 3 = 2 mod 3\" (* Since 2 is coprime to 6, we can divide *)\n    by (metis coprime_nat_def)\n\n  (* Step 7: Express k in terms of m *)\n  have \"k = 3m + 2\" for some integer m\n\n  (* Step 8: Substitute back into N *)\n  have \"N = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 21\" (* Substituting back into the expression for N *)\n  \n  (* Step 9: Now we need to find values of m such that N < 50 *)\n  have \"24m + 21 < 50\" (* Inequality for N *)\n  proof -\n    have \"24m < 29\" by (simp)\n    thus ?thesis by simp\n  qed\n  \n  (* Step 10: Solve for m *)\n  have \"m < 29 / 24\" (* which gives m \u2264 1 since m is a natural number *)\n    by (simp add: less_divide_eq)\n  \n  (* Step 11: Possible values for m are 0 and 1 *)\n  have \"N = 21\" if \"m = 0\" using that by simp\n  have \"N = 45\" if \"m = 1\" using that by simp\n  \n  (* Step 12: Sum valid values of N *)\n  have \"21 + 45 = 66\" by simp\n  \n  (* Final conclusion *)\n  show ?thesis by (simp add: that)\nqed\n\nend\n```"}}
