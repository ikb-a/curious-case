We can write the equations as $\\frac{c}{3} + 2*\\frac{d}{2}=5$ and $\\frac{d}{3} + 2*\\frac{c}{2}=7$. Solving the equations and we get $c=6$ and $d=3$. Hence $a=2^6=64$ and $b=2^3=8$.

We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer.

We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer. Thus the 2 solutions less than $50$ are 21 and $21+24(1) = 45$, and their sum is $21+45=66$.", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_149 \n  imports Complex_Main \"HOL-Computational_Algebra.Computational_Algebra\"\n  \"HOL-Number_Theory.Number_Theory\"\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n  sorry\n\nend   "}, "verified_result": {"success": false, "reason": "Step error: Failed to finish proof (line 23):\ngoal (1 subgoal):\n 1. \\<lbrakk>N = 8 * k + 5; 8 * k < 45\\<rbrakk> \\<Longrightarrow> False\nAt command \"'by (simp add: mod_add_right_eq)'\" (line 23)", "num_steps": 55, "last_step": 19, "error_step_index": 18, "step_results": [{"index": 0, "step": "theory mathd_numbertheory_149\n  imports Complex_Main\nbegin", "output": "", "step_time": 0.0039119720458984375}, {"index": 1, "step": "\n\n(* Lemma to express N in terms of k for the first congruence condition *)\n", "output": "", "step_time": 0.0031092166900634766}, {"index": 2, "step": "lemma congruence_mod_8:\n  fixes k :: nat\n  assumes \"0 \\<le> k\"\n  shows \"k mod 8 = 5 \\<Longrightarrow> (\\<exists>N.
