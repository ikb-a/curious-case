It suffices to show $\\sqrt{2} \\leq x + \\frac{1}{2x}$. Let $y = \\sqrt{2}$. $y*y = 2$. Then $2x*x + 1 - 2x * \\sqrt{2} = y*y * x*x + 1 - 2xy = (xy - 1)^2 \\geq 0$. Also notice that $2x*x + 1 - 2x * \\sqrt{2} = 2x * (x + \\frac{1}{2x} - \\sqrt{2})$. Therefore $x + \\frac{1}{2x} - \\sqrt{2} \\geq 0$, given $2x > 0$.

What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nWe are given that $N\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $N\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$.  We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer.

What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: We start with the congruences given in the problem: \\( N \\equiv 5 \\mod 8 \\) and \\( N \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\).\n\nStep 2: From the first congruence, we can express \\( N \\) in the form \\( N = 8k + 5 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nStep 3: Substitute this expression into the second congruence: \n\\[\n8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6.\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6.\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Rearranging gives:\n\\[\n2k \\equiv -2 \\mod 6 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 2k \\equiv 4 \\mod 6.\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Dividing through by 2 (noting that 2 and 6 are coprime), we have:\n\\[\nk \\equiv 2 \\mod 3.\n\\]\nThus, we can express \\( k \\) as \\( k = 3m + 2 \\) for some integer \\( m \\).\n\nStep 6: Substitute back into the expression for \\( N \\):\n\\[\nN = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21.\n\\]\n\nStep 7: We need \\( N < 50 \\), so we solve:\n\\[\n24m + 21 < 50 \\implies 24m < 29 \\implies m < \\frac{29}{24} \\implies m \\leq 1.\n\\]\n\nStep 8: The possible values for \\( m \\) are \\( 0 \\) and \\( 1 \\):\n- For \\( m = 0 \\): \\( N = 21 \\).\n- For \\( m = 1 \\): \\( N = 45 \\).\n\nStep 9: The valid values of \\( N \\) are \\( 21 \\) and \\( 45 \\). Their sum is:\n\\[\n21 + 45 = 66.\n\\]\n\nStep 10: Conclude that the sum of all possible values of \\( N \\) is \\( 66 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n```\n\n## Proof", "action_agent_ai0": "```isabelle\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_149\n  imports Complex_Main\nbegin\n\n(* formal statement copy from the input *)\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\nproof -\n  (* Step 1: We start with the congruences given in the problem: \\( N \\equiv 5 \\mod 8 \\) and \\( N \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\). *)\n  let ?N = \"x::nat\"\n\n  (* Step 2: From the first congruence, we can express \\( N \\) in the form \\( N = 8k + 5 \\) for some integer \\( k \\). *)\n  have \"(\\<exists>k. ?N = 8 * k + 5)\" using mod_8_eq_5 by blast\n\n  (* Step 3: Substitute this expression into the second congruence: \\( 8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\). *)\n  have \"8 * k + 5 mod 6 = 3\" \n    by (metis mod_diff_eq mod_8_eq_5)\n\n  (* Step 4: Simplifying gives: \\( 2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\). *)\n  have \"2 * k + 5 mod 6 = 3\"\n    by (metis mod_add_eq)\n\n  (* Step 5: Rearranging gives: \\( 2k \\equiv -2 \\mod 6 \\) or \\( 2k \\equiv 4 \\mod 6 \\). *)\n  have \"2 * k mod 6 = 4\"\n    by (metis add.commute)\n\n  (* Step 6: Dividing through by 2 (noting that 2 and 6 are coprime), we have: \\( k \\equiv 2 \\mod 3 \\). *)\n  have \"k mod 3 = 2\"\n    by (metis coprime_divisors)\n\n  (* Thus, we can express \\( k \\) as \\( k = 3m + 2 \\) for some integer \\( m \\). *)\n  let ?k = \"3 * m + 2\"\n\n  (* Step 7: Substitute back into the expression for \\( N \\): \\( N = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 21 \\). *)\n  have \"?N = 24 * m + 21\" \n    by (metis add.commute)\n\n  (* Step 8: We need \\( N < 50 \\), so we solve: \\( 24m + 21 < 50 \\). *)\n  have \"24 * m + 21 < 50 \\<longleftrightarrow> 24 * m < 29 \\<longleftrightarrow> m < 29 / 24 \\<longleftrightarrow> m \\<le> 1\"\n    by linarith\n\n  (* Step 9: The possible values for \\( m \\) are \\( 0 \\) and \\( 1 \\): *)\n  have \"m = 0 \\<Longrightarrow> ?N = 21\" by simp\n  have \"m = 1 \\<Longrightarrow> ?N = 45\" by simp\n\n  (* Step 10: The valid values of \\( N \\) are \\( 21 \\) and \\( 45 \\).
