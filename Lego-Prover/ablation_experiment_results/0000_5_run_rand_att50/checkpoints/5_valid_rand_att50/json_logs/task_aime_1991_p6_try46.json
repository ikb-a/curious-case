Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$. Solving shows that $\\frac{743}{100} \\le r < \\frac{744}{100}$, so $743\\le 100r < 744$, and $\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

The sum is taken from \\( k = 19 \\) to \\( k = 91 \\), which gives us \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that each term in the sum, \\( \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\right\\rfloor \\), can either be \\( \\lfloor r + 0.19 \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r + 0.91 \\rfloor \\), and thus can take on values that differ by at most 1.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the average value of the terms in the sum. Since the total sum is 546 and there are 73 terms, the average is \\( \\frac{546}{73} = 7 \\) with a remainder of 35. This indicates that 35 of the terms must be 8, and the remaining \\( 73 - 35 = 38 \\) terms must be 7.\n\nStep 4: Determine the implications of the distribution of 7s and 8s. The first term that is 8 corresponds to \\( k = 57 \\), which gives us the inequality \\( 8 \\leq r + 0.57 < 8.01 \\). \n\nStep 5: Rearranging the inequality gives us \\( 7.43 \\leq r < 7.44 \\).

Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the summation. The sum is taken from \\( k = 19 \\) to \\( k = 91 \\), which gives us \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that each term in the sum, \\( \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\right\\rfloor \\), can either be \\( \\lfloor r + 0.19 \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r + 0.91 \\rfloor \\), and thus can take on values that differ by at most 1.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the average value of the terms in the sum. Since the total sum is 546 and there are 73 terms, the average is \\( \\frac{546}{73} = 7 \\) with a remainder of 35. This indicates that 35 of the terms must be 8, and the remaining \\( 73 - 35 = 38 \\) terms must be 7.\n\nStep 4: Determine the implications of the distribution of 7s and 8s. The first term that is 8 corresponds to \\( k = 57 \\), which gives us the inequality \\( 8 \\leq r + 0.57 < 8.01 \\). \n\nStep 5: Rearranging the inequality gives us \\( 7.43 \\leq r < 7.44 \\). Multiplying through by 100 yields \\( 743 \\leq 100r < 744 \\).\n\nStep 6: Conclude that \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

(For real $x^{}_{}$, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the [[floor function|greatest integer]] less than or equal to $x^{}_{}$.) Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the summation. The sum is taken from \\( k = 19 \\) to \\( k = 91 \\), which gives us \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that each term in the sum, \\( \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\right\\rfloor \\), can either be \\( \\lfloor r + 0.19 \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r + 0.91 \\rfloor \\), and thus can take on values that differ by at most 1.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the average value of the terms in the sum. Since the total sum is 546 and there are 73 terms, the average is \\( \\frac{546}{73} = 7 \\) with a remainder of 35. This indicates that 35 of the terms must be 8, and the remaining \\( 73 - 35 = 38 \\) terms must be 7.\n\nStep 4: Determine the implications of the distribution of 7s and 8s. The first term that is 8 corresponds to \\( k = 57 \\), which gives us the inequality \\( 8 \\leq r + 0.57 < 8.01 \\). \n\nStep 5: Rearranging the inequality gives us \\( 7.43 \\leq r < 7.44 \\). Multiplying through by 100 yields \\( 743 \\leq 100r < 744 \\).\n\nStep 6: Conclude that \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
