What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nWe are given that $N\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $N\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$.  We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer.

What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: We start with the congruences given in the problem: \\( N \\equiv 5 \\mod 8 \\) and \\( N \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\).\n\nStep 2: From the first congruence, we can express \\( N \\) in the form \\( N = 8k + 5 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nStep 3: Substitute \\( N \\) into the second congruence:\n\\[\n8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6.\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6.\n\\]\nSubtracting 5 from both sides gives:\n\\[\n2k \\equiv -2 \\mod 6 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 2k \\equiv 4 \\mod 6.\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Dividing through by 2 (noting that 2 and 6 are coprime), we have:\n\\[\nk \\equiv 2 \\mod 3.\n\\]\nThus, we can express \\( k \\) as \\( k = 3m + 2 \\) for some integer \\( m \\).\n\nStep 5: Substitute back into the expression for \\( N \\):\n\\[\nN = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21.\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Now we need to find values of \\( N \\) that are less than 50:\n\\[\n24m + 21 < 50 \\implies 24m < 29 \\implies m < \\frac{29}{24} \\implies m \\leq 1.\n\\]\nThus, \\( m \\) can take values 0 or 1.\n\nStep 7: Calculate the possible values of \\( N \\):\n- For \\( m = 0 \\): \\( N = 24(0) + 21 = 21 \\).\n- For \\( m = 1 \\): \\( N = 24(1) + 21 = 45 \\).\n\nStep 8: The possible values of \\( N \\) are 21 and 45. Their sum is:\n\\[\n21 + 45 = 66.\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n```\n\n## Proof", "action_agent_ai0": "```isabelle\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_149\n  imports Complex_Main\nbegin\n\n(* lemma 1: This lemma helps to find values satisfying the two congruences *)\nlemma find_values:\n  fixes N :: nat\n  assumes \"N < 50\"\n  shows \"(N mod 8 = 5) = (N = 8 * k + 5) for some k\" and \"(N mod 6 = 3) = (N = 6 * m + 3) for some m\"\nproof -\n  {\n    fix k\n    obtain m where \"N = 8 * k + 5\" using assms by auto\n    hence \"N mod 8 = 5\" by simp\n  }\n  thus \"(N mod 8 = 5) = (N = 8 * k + 5) for some k\" by auto\n  \n  {\n    fix m\n    obtain k where \"N = 6 * m + 3\" using assms by auto\n    hence \"N mod 6 = 3\" by simp\n  }\n  thus \"(N mod 6 = 3) = (N = 6 * m + 3) for some m\" by auto\nqed\n\n(* formal statement copy from the input *)\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\nproof -\n  (* Step 1: Establish the congruences N \u2261 5 (mod 8) and N \u2261 3 (mod 6). *)\n  let ?S = \"{x::nat. x < 50 \\<and> x mod 8 = 5 \\<and> x mod 6 = 3}\"\n  \n  (* Step 2: We need to find k such that N = 8k + 5. *)\n  have \"N mod 8 = 5 \u27f7 \u2203k.
