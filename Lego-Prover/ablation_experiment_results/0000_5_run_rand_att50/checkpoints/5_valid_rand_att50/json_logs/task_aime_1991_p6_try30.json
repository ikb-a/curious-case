Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$.

Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$ Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$.

The base case is trivial. Inductive case: when n is 0 it is also trivial. When $n>0$, let $m=2^n$, and we have $3^m - 1 \\equiv 4*m \\pmod{8*m}$. Then there is $k$ where $3^m - 1 = (8*m)*k + 4*m$.

(For real $x^{}_{}$, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the [[floor function|greatest integer]] less than or equal to $x^{}_{}$.) Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the summation, which is from \\( k = 19 \\) to \\( k = 91 \\). This gives us a total of \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms.\n\nStep 2: Since the floor function can only take integer values, each term \\( \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\right\\rfloor \\) can either be \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\). \n\nStep 3: Let \\( a \\) be the number of terms equal to \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) and \\( b \\) be the number of terms equal to \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\). We have the equations:\n- \\( a + b = 73 \\)\n- \\( a \\cdot \\lfloor r \\rfloor + b \\cdot (\\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1) = 546 \\)\n\nStep 4: Substitute \\( b = 73 - a \\) into the second equation:\n\\[\na \\cdot \\lfloor r \\rfloor + (73 - a) \\cdot (\\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1) = 546\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n73 \\cdot \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 73 - a = 546\n\\]\nThus, we can express \\( a \\) as:\n\\[\na = 73 \\cdot \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 73 - 546\n\\]\n\\[\na = 73 \\cdot \\lfloor r \\rfloor - 473\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Since \\( a \\) must be non-negative, we have:\n\\[\n73 \\cdot \\lfloor r \\rfloor - 473 \\geq 0 \\implies \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\geq \\frac{473}{73} \\approx 6.5\n\\]\nThus, \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\geq 7 \\).\n\nStep 6: Now, substituting \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor = 7 \\):\n\\[\na = 73 \\cdot 7 - 473 = 511 - 473 = 38\n\\]\nThis means \\( b = 73 - 38 = 35 \\).\n\nStep 7: The values of \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k = 19, \\ldots, 91 \\) must satisfy:\n- For 38 terms, \\( \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\right\\rfloor = 7 \\)\n- For 35 terms, \\( \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\right\\rfloor = 8 \\)\n\nStep 8: The first term where \\( \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\right\\rfloor = 8 \\) occurs when \\( k = 57 \\):\n\\[\n8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01 \\implies 7.43 \\leq r < 7.44\n\\]\n\nStep 9: Multiplying through by 100 gives:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744\n\\]\nThus, \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
