Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$. Solving shows that $\\frac{743}{100} \\le r < \\frac{744}{100}$, so $743\\le 100r < 744$, and $\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

The sum consists of 73 terms from \\( \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{19}{100} \\right\\rfloor \\) to \\( \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{91}{100} \\right\\rfloor \\).\n\nStep 2: Recognize that each term can either be \\( \\lfloor r + k/100 \\rfloor \\) where \\( k \\) ranges from 19 to 91. The values of these terms can only differ by at most 1.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the average of the sum: \n\\[\n\\frac{546}{73} = 7 \\text{ remainder } 35.\n\\]\nThis indicates that the terms can be either 7 or 8.\n\nStep 4: Let \\( x \\) be the number of terms equal to 8. Then, the number of terms equal to 7 is \\( 73 - x \\). The equation for the sum becomes:\n\\[\n7(73 - x) + 8x = 546.\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Simplifying gives:\n\\[\n511 - 7x + 8x = 546 \\implies x = 35.\n\\]\nThus, there are 35 terms equal to 8 and \\( 73 - 35 = 38 \\) terms equal to 7.\n\nStep 6: The first term that equals 8 is \\( \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\right\\rfloor \\). This implies:\n\\[\n8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01.\n\\]\n\nStep 7: Rearranging gives:\n\\[\n8 - \\frac{57}{100} \\leq r < 8.01 - \\frac{57}{100} \\implies \\frac{743}{100} \\leq r < \\frac{744}{100}.\n\\]\n\nStep 8: Therefore, multiplying by 100 gives:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744.\n\\]\nThus, \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
