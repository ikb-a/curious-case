We can write the equations as $\\frac{c}{3} + 2*\\frac{d}{2}=5$ and $\\frac{d}{3} + 2*\\frac{c}{2}=7$. Solving the equations and we get $c=6$ and $d=3$. Hence $a=2^6=64$ and $b=2^3=8$.

What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nWe are given that $N\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $N\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$.  We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer.

What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: We start with the congruences given in the problem: \\( N \\equiv 5 \\mod 8 \\) and \\( N \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\).\n\nStep 2: From the first congruence, we can express \\( N \\) in the form \\( N = 8k + 5 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nStep 3: Substitute \\( N \\) into the second congruence: \n\\[\n8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6.\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6.\n\\]\nSubtracting 5 from both sides gives:\n\\[\n2k \\equiv -2 \\mod 6,\n\\]\nwhich is equivalent to:\n\\[\n2k \\equiv 4 \\mod 6.\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Dividing the entire equation by 2 (noting that 2 and 6 are coprime), we get:\n\\[\nk \\equiv 2 \\mod 3.\n\\]\nThus, we can express \\( k \\) as \\( k = 3m + 2 \\) for some integer \\( m \\).\n\nStep 5: Substitute back into the expression for \\( N \\):\n\\[\nN = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21.\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Now we need to find values of \\( N \\) such that \\( N < 50 \\):\n\\[\n24m + 21 < 50 \\implies 24m < 29 \\implies m < \\frac{29}{24} \\implies m \\leq 1.\n\\]\nThus, \\( m \\) can take values 0 or 1.\n\nStep 7: Calculate the possible values of \\( N \\):\n- For \\( m = 0 \\): \\( N = 24(0) + 21 = 21 \\).\n- For \\( m = 1 \\): \\( N = 24(1) + 21 = 45 \\).\n\nStep 8: The possible values of \\( N \\) are 21 and 45. Their sum is:\n\\[\n21 + 45 = 66.\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n```\n\n## Proof", "action_agent_ai0": "```isabelle\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_149\n  imports Complex_Main\nbegin\n\n(* lemma 1: A lemma that helps to find all values of N satisfying the given congruences *)\nlemma congruences:\n  fixes N :: nat\n  assumes \"N < 50\"\n    and \"N mod 8 = 5\"\n    and \"N mod 6 = 3\"\n  shows \"N = 21 \u2228 N = 45\"\nproof -\n  (* Step 1: Express N in terms of k from the first congruence, N \u2261 5 mod 8 *)\n  have \"N = 8k + 5\" for k :: nat\n    using assms(2) by auto\n\n  (* Step 2: Substitute N into the second congruence: 8k + 5 \u2261 3 mod 6 *)\n  have \"8k + 5 mod 6 = 3\" \n    by (simp add: mod_eq_0_iff_dvd)\n  then have \"2k + 5 \u2261 3 mod 6\" \n    by (simp add: of_nat_8)\n\n  (* Step 3: Simplifying the above congruence *)\n  have \"2k \u2261 -2 mod 6\" \n    by (simp add: of_nat_6)\n  then have \"2k \u2261 4 mod 6\" \n    by (simp add: of_nat_6)\n\n  (* Step 4: Dividing through by 2, gives us k \u2261 2 mod 3 *)\n  have \"k = 3m + 2\" for m :: nat\n    using assms(3) by (metis mod_less)\n  \n  (* Step 5: Substitute back into N, N = 8(3m + 2) + 5 *)\n  have \"N = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21\" for m :: nat\n    by simp\n\n  (* Step 6: Now we need to find values of N such that N < 50 *)\n  have \"24m + 21 < 50\" \n    by (simp add: assms(1))\n  then have \"24m < 29\" \n    by simp\n  then have \"m < 29 / 24\" \n    by simp\n  then have \"m \u2264 1\" \n    by (metis nat_less_iff)\n  \n  (* Step 7: Calculate the possible values of N *)\n  obtain m where \"m = 0 \u2228 m = 1\" by (metis)\n  then show \"N = 21 \u2228 N = 45\" \n    by (cases m) (auto simp: algebra_simps)\nqed\n\n(* formal statement copy from the input *)\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\nproof -\n  (* Step 1: Find all possible values of N that satisfy the congruences *)\n  have \"21 \u2208 {x::nat. x<50 \u2227 x mod 8 = 5 \u2227 x mod 6 = 3}\" \n    using congruences(1)[of 21] by auto\n  have \"45 \u2208 {x::nat. x<50 \u2227 x mod 8 = 5 \u2227 x mod 6 = 3}\" \n    using congruences(1)[of 45] by auto\n  \n  (* Step 2: Sum the values found *)\n  have \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {21, 45}. k) = 21 + 45\"\n    by simp\n  thus ?thesis by simp\nqed\n\nend\n```"}}
