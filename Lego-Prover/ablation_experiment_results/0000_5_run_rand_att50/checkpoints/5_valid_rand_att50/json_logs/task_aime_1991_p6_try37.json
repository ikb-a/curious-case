Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$. Solving shows that $\\frac{743}{100} \\le r < \\frac{744}{100}$, so $743\\le 100r < 744$, and $\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

Since the total sum is 546 and there are 73 terms, the average is \\( \\frac{546}{73} = 7 \\) with a remainder of 35.

The 39th term corresponds to \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor \\), which must be 8.

(For real $x^{}_{}$, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the [[floor function|greatest integer]] less than or equal to $x^{}_{}$.) Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the summation. The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us 73 terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that the floor function can yield either \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor + 1 \\), leading to two possible values for each term in the sum.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the average value of the terms in the sum. Since the total sum is 546 and there are 73 terms, the average is \\( \\frac{546}{73} = 7 \\) with a remainder of 35. This indicates that 35 of the terms must be 8, and the remaining 38 must be 7.\n\nStep 4: Determine the critical point where the transition from 7 to 8 occurs. The 39th term corresponds to \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor \\), which must be 8. Thus, we have the inequality \\( 8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01 \\).\n\nStep 5: Solve the inequalities to find bounds for \\( r \\). From \\( 8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} \\), we get \\( r \\geq 8 - 0.57 = 7.43 \\). From \\( r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01 \\), we get \\( r < 8.01 - 0.57 = 7.44 \\).\n\nStep 6: Conclude that \\( 7.43 \\leq r < 7.44 \\). Multiplying through by 100 gives \\( 743 \\leq 100r < 744 \\), leading to \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the summation. The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us 73 terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that the floor function can yield either \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor + 1 \\), leading to two possible values for each term in the sum.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the average value of the terms in the sum. Since the total sum is 546 and there are 73 terms, the average is \\( \\frac{546}{73} = 7 \\) with a remainder of 35. This indicates that 35 of the terms must be 8, and the remaining 38 must be 7.\n\nStep 4: Determine the critical point where the transition from 7 to 8 occurs. The 39th term corresponds to \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor \\), which must be 8. Thus, we have the inequality \\( 8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01 \\).\n\nStep 5: Solve the inequalities to find bounds for \\( r \\). From \\( 8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} \\), we get \\( r \\geq 8 - 0.57 = 7.43 \\). From \\( r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01 \\), we get \\( r < 8.01 - 0.57 = 7.44 \\).\n\nStep 6: Conclude that \\( 7.43 \\leq r < 7.44 \\).
