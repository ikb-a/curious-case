Show that it is 512.\n\n## Informal proof\nWe first calculate that $\\log_2=1$, $\\log_4=2$, and $\\log_8=3$. Then let $c=\\log_a$ and $d=\\log_b$. We can write the equations as $\\frac{c}{3} + 2*\\frac{d}{2}=5$ and $\\frac{d}{3} + 2*\\frac{c}{2}=7$. Solving the equations and we get $c=6$ and $d=3$. Hence $a=2^6=64$ and $b=2^3=8$.

The equations become $\\frac{c}{3} + \\frac{2d}{2} = 5$ and $\\frac{d}{3} + \\frac{2c}{2} = 7$.\nStep 4: Solve the linear equations to find that $c = 6$ and $d = 3$.\nStep 5: Use the values of c and d to find $a = 2^6 = 64$ and $b = 2^3 = 8$.\nStep 6: Finally, show that $a * b = 64 * 8 = 512$ to conclude the proof.\n\n## Request skills\n### Thoughts 1\nIt would be particularly helpful to have experience solving systems of linear equations since it required to solve the linear equations in step 4.\n\n### Code 1\n```isabelle\nlemma find_a_b_value:\n  fixes c d :: real\n  assumes \n    \"c/3 + d/1 = 5\"\n    \"d/3 + c/1 = 7\"\n  shows \"c = 6 \\<and> d = 3\"\n```\n\n### Thoughts 2\nIt would be helpful for step 1 if there exists lemma that calculate the base 2 logarithms of the original bases in the equations. \n\n### Code 2\n```isabelle\nlemma log_base_to_power_equals_exponent:\n  fixes a :: real\n  assumes \"a > 0\" \"a \\<noteq> 1\" \"n > 0\"\n  shows \"log a (a^n) = n\"\n```\n\n### Thoughts 3\nIn step 5 they uses the log definition to calculate the value of a and b, which require to calculate the antilogarithm_identity which calculate the value of $b = a^c$ given $log_a b = c$\n\n### Code 3\n```isabelle\nlemma antilogarithm_identity:\n  assumes \"a > 0\" and \"a \\<noteq> 1\" and \"b > 0\" and \"log a b = c\"\n  shows \"b = a ^ c\"\n```\n\n\n####################\n\n## Problems\nShow that for any positive integer $n$, we have $3^{2^n} - 1 \\equiv 2^{n+2} \\pmod{2^{n+3}}$.\n\n## Informal proof\nWe prove by induction on n. The base case is trivial. Inductive case: when n is 0 it is also trivial. When $n>0$, let $m=2^n$, and we have $3^m - 1 \\equiv 4*m \\pmod{8*m}$. Then there is $k$ where $3^m - 1 = (8*m)*k + 4*m$. Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$ Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$.
