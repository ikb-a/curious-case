What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nWe are given that $N\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $N\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$.  We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer.

The base case is trivial. Inductive case: when n is 0 it is also trivial. When $n>0$, let $m=2^n$, and we have $3^m - 1 \\equiv 4*m \\pmod{8*m}$. Then there is $k$ where $3^m - 1 = (8*m)*k + 4*m$. Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$ Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$.

What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: We start with the congruences given in the problem: \\( N \\equiv 5 \\mod{8} \\) and \\( N \\equiv 3 \\mod{6} \\).\n\nStep 2: From the first congruence, we can express \\( N \\) in the form \\( N = 8k + 5 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nStep 3: Substitute \\( N \\) into the second congruence: \n\\[\n8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod{6}.\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod{6} \\implies 2k \\equiv -2 \\equiv 4 \\mod{6}.\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Dividing the entire equation by 2 (noting that 2 and 6 are coprime), we get:\n\\[\nk \\equiv 2 \\mod{3}.\n\\]\nThus, we can express \\( k \\) as \\( k = 3m + 2 \\) for some integer \\( m \\).\n\nStep 5: Substitute back into the expression for \\( N \\):\n\\[\nN = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21.\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Now we need to find values of \\( N \\) such that \\( N < 50 \\):\n\\[\n24m + 21 < 50 \\implies 24m < 29 \\implies m < \\frac{29}{24} \\implies m \\leq 1.\n\\]\n\nStep 7: The possible values for \\( m \\) are \\( 0 \\) and \\( 1 \\):\n- For \\( m = 0 \\): \\( N = 21 \\).\n- For \\( m = 1 \\): \\( N = 45 \\).\n\nStep 8: The valid values of \\( N \\) are \\( 21 \\) and \\( 45 \\). Their sum is:\n\\[\n21 + 45 = 66.\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n```\n\n## Proof", "action_agent_ai0": "```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\nproof -\n  (* Step 1: We start with the congruences given in the problem: N \u2261 5 mod 8 and N \u2261 3 mod 6. *)\n  let ?S = \"{x::nat. x < 50 \\<and> x mod 8 = 5 \\<and> x mod 6 = 3}\"\n  \n  (* Step 2: Express N in the form N = 8k + 5 for some integer k. *)\n  have \"N = 8k + 5\" for k :: nat\n    by (metis mod_5_eq_3)\n\n  (* Step 3: Substitute N into the second congruence: 8k + 5 \u2261 3 mod 6. *)\n  (* This simplifies to 2k + 5 \u2261 3 mod 6, or 2k \u2261 -2 \u2261 4 mod 6. *)\n  have \"2 * (k mod 3) = 4 mod 6\" \n    by (metis mod_eq_0_iff_dvd)\n\n  (* Step 4: Dividing the entire equation by 2 gives k \u2261 2 mod 3. *)\n  have \"k mod 3 = 2\" \n    by (metis even_iff_mod_2)\n\n  (* Thus, k can be expressed as k = 3m + 2 for some integer m. *)\n  let ?k = \"3 * m + 2\"\n  \n  (* Step 5: Substitute back into N: N = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 21. *)\n  have \"N = 24 * m + 21\" \n    by (metis add.commute)\n\n  (* Step 6: We now find values of N such that N < 50: 24m + 21 < 50. *)\n  have \"24 * m < 29 \\<Longrightarrow> m < 29 / 24\"\n    by simp\n  \n  (* This implies m = 0 or m = 1. *)\n  have \"m \\<le> 1\"\n    by simp\n  \n  (* Step 7: The possible values for m are 0 and 1: *)\n  obtain N where \"N = 21\" if \"m = 0\" \n    by (metis that)\n  \n  obtain N where \"N = 45\" if \"m = 1\" \n    by (metis that)\n  \n  (* Step 8: The valid values of N are 21 and 45.
