Show that it is 12.\n\n## Informal proof\nLet $y = x \\sin x$. It suffices to show that $12 \\leq \\frac{9y^2 + 4}{y}. It is trivial to see that $y > 0$. Then one can multiply both sides by $y$ and it suffices to show $12y \\leq 9y^2 + 4$. This can be done by the sum of squares method.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem\n  fixes x::real\n  assumes \"0<x\" \"x<pi\"\n  shows \"12 \\<le> ((9 * (x^2 * (sin x)^2)) + 4) / (x * sin x)\"\n```\n\n## Structured informal proof\nStep 1: Define a new variable y as x * sin(x) to simplify the expression.\nStep 2: Our new goal becomes showing that 12 <= (9 * y^2 + 4) / y\nStep 3: Prove that y is greater than 0, given the constraints on x.\nStep 4: Using Sum of Squares (SoS) techniques, show that 9 * y^2 + 4 >= 12 * y.\nStep 5: Re-express the inequality in terms of x and sin(x) to conclude the proof.\n\n## Request skills\n### Thoughts 1\nThe proof requires to use Sum of Squares techniques, thus a skill that demonstrate the use of Sum of Squares techniques will be useful\n\n### Code 1\n```isabelle\nlemma\n   fixes y::real\n   shows \"(9 * y^2 + 4) \\<ge> 12 * y\"\n```\n\n\n####################\n\n## Problems\nIf $321_{b}$ is equal to the base 10 integer 57, find $b$ given that $b>0$.
