We can rewrite it as \\( (n-2)(n-1) \\).\n\nStep 2: Analyze the factors \\( n-1 \\) and \\( n-2 \\). Since \\( n \\) is a positive integer, both \\( n-1 \\) and \\( n-2 \\) are non-negative integers. \n\nStep 3: Determine the parity of the factors. One of \\( n-1 \\) or \\( n-2 \\) is odd, and the other is even. The product of an even number and an odd number is even.\n\nStep 4: Recall that the only even prime number is \\( 2 \\). Therefore, we need to find when \\( (n-2)(n-1) = 2 \\).\n\nStep 5: Set up the equations based on the factorization:\n- Case 1: \\( n-2 = 1 \\) and \\( n-1 = 2 \\) leads to \\( n = 3 \\).\n- Case 2: \\( n-2 = 2 \\) and \\( n-1 = 1 \\) leads to \\( n = 0 \\) (not a positive integer).\n\nStep 6: Conclude that the only positive integer \\( n \\) for which \\( n^2 - 3n + 2 \\) is prime is \\( n = 3 \\).\n\nStep 7: Therefore, the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that \\( n^2 - 3n + 2 \\) is prime is exactly one.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem amc12b_2002_p3:\n  fixes n ::nat\n  assumes \"n>0\"\n    and prime:\"prime (n^2+2-3*n)\"\n  shows \"n=3\"\n```\n\n## Proof"}}
