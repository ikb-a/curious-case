The base case is trivial. Inductive case: when n is 0 it is also trivial. When $n>0$, let $m=2^n$, and we have $3^m - 1 \\equiv 4*m \\pmod{8*m}$. Then there is $k$ where $3^m - 1 = (8*m)*k + 4*m$. Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$ Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$.

Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$.

Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the summation. The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us 73 terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that since the floor function can only take integer values, the terms \\( \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\right\\rfloor \\) can either be \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( n = \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\). Then, we can express the sum as:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=19}^{91} \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\right\\rfloor = m(n + 1) + (73 - m)n = 546\n\\]\nwhere \\( m \\) is the number of terms equal to \\( n + 1 \\).\n\nStep 4: The total number of terms is 73, so we can express \\( m \\) in terms of \\( n \\):\n\\[\nm + (73 - m) = 73\n\\]\nThis leads to:\n\\[\nm(n + 1) + (73 - m)n = 546\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\nm + 73n = 546\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Rearranging gives:\n\\[\nm = 546 - 73n\n\\]\nSince \\( m \\) must be a non-negative integer, we have:\n\\[\n546 - 73n \\geq 0 \\implies n \\leq \\frac{546}{73} \\approx 7.48\n\\]\nThus, \\( n \\) can take values 0 through 7.\n\nStep 6: Calculate \\( m \\) for possible values of \\( n \\):\n- If \\( n = 7 \\):\n  \\[\n  m = 546 - 73 \\cdot 7 = 547 - 511 = 35\n  \\]\n- If \\( n = 6 \\):\n  \\[\n  m = 546 - 73 \\cdot 6 = 546 - 438 = 108 \\quad (\\text{not possible since } m \\leq 73)\n  \\]\n\nStep 7: Conclude that \\( n = 7 \\) and \\( m = 35 \\) is the only valid solution. This means there are 35 terms equal to 8 and 38 terms equal to 7.\n\nStep 8: The first term that equals 8 occurs at \\( k = 57 \\):\n\\[\n\\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\implies 8 \\leq r + 0.57 < 8.01\n\\]\nThis leads to:\n\\[\n7.43 \\leq r < 7.44\n\\]\n\nStep 9: Multiply through by 100 to find \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor \\):\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744\n\\]\nThus, \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
