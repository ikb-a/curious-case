It suffices to show $\\sqrt{2} \\leq x + \\frac{1}{2x}$. Let $y = \\sqrt{2}$. $y*y = 2$. Then $2x*x + 1 - 2x * \\sqrt{2} = y*y * x*x + 1 - 2xy = (xy - 1)^2 \\geq 0$. Also notice that $2x*x + 1 - 2x * \\sqrt{2} = 2x * (x + \\frac{1}{2x} - \\sqrt{2})$. Therefore $x + \\frac{1}{2x} - \\sqrt{2} \\geq 0$, given $2x > 0$.

Let $b = a mod 3$. We know that b can only be 0, 1, or 2. Also, $a^2 mod 3 = b^2 mod 3$. If $b=0$, $a^2 mod 3 = 0^2 mod 3 = 0$; If $b=1$, $a^2 mod 3 = 1^2 mod 3 = 1$; If $b=2$, $a^2 mod 3 = 2^2 mod 3 = 1$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem\n  fixes a :: int\n  shows \"a^2 mod 3 = 0 \\<or> a^2 mod 3 = 1\"\n```\n\n## Structured informal proof\nStep 1: Introduce a new variable $b$ such that $b = a \\mod 3$. This simplifies the expression since $b$ can only be 0, 1, or 2.\nStep 2: State that $a^2 \\mod 3 = b^2 \\mod 3$, which can be proved using the properties of modulo arithmetic.\nStep 3: Enumerate the cases for $b$, i.e., $b = 0$, $b = 1$, or $b = 2$.\nStep 4: For each case, calculate $b^2 \\mod 3$.
