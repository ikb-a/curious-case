Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$. Solving shows that $\\frac{743}{100} \\le r < \\frac{744}{100}$, so $743\\le 100r < 744$, and $\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us a total of \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that the floor function can only change by at most 1 for consecutive values of \\( k \\). Therefore, the values of \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) can either be \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( n = \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\). Then, we can express the sum as:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=19}^{91} \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = \\sum_{k=19}^{91} (n + m_k)\n\\]\nwhere \\( m_k \\) is 0 if \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} < n + 1 \\) and 1 if \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\geq n + 1 \\).\n\nStep 4: The total number of terms is 73, so we can denote the number of terms contributing 1 as \\( m \\) and those contributing 0 as \\( 73 - m \\). The equation becomes:\n\\[\n(n)(73) + m = 546\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\n73n + m = 546\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Rearranging gives:\n\\[\nm = 546 - 73n\n\\]\nSince \\( m \\) must be a non-negative integer, we have:\n\\[\n546 - 73n \\geq 0 \\implies n \\leq \\frac{546}{73} \\approx 7.48\n\\]\nThus, \\( n \\) can take values 0 through 7.\n\nStep 6: We also need \\( m \\) to be less than or equal to 73, which gives:\n\\[\n546 - 73n \\leq 73 \\implies 546 - 73 \\leq 73n \\implies 473 \\leq 73n \\implies n \\geq \\frac{473}{73} \\approx 6.48\n\\]\nThus, \\( n \\) can only be 7.\n\nStep 7: Substitute \\( n = 7 \\) back into the equation for \\( m \\):\n\\[\nm = 546 - 73 \\cdot 7 = 546 - 511 = 35\n\\]\nThis means that 35 of the terms must be \\( 8 \\) (i.e., \\( n + 1 \\)).\n\nStep 8: The first term where \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\) occurs when:\n\\[\nr + \\frac{57}{100} \\geq 8 \\implies r \\geq 8 -

Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$ Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$.

The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us a total of \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that the floor function can only change by at most 1 for consecutive values of \\( k \\). Therefore, the values of \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) can either be \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( n = \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\). Then, we can express the sum as:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=19}^{91} \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = \\sum_{k=19}^{91} (n + m_k)\n\\]\nwhere \\( m_k \\) is 0 if \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} < n + 1 \\) and 1 if \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\geq n + 1 \\).\n\nStep 4: The total number of terms is 73, so we can denote the number of terms contributing 1 as \\( m \\) and those contributing 0 as \\( 73 - m \\). The equation becomes:\n\\[\n(n)(73) + m = 546\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\n73n + m = 546\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Rearranging gives:\n\\[\nm = 546 - 73n\n\\]\nSince \\( m \\) must be a non-negative integer, we have:\n\\[\n546 - 73n \\geq 0 \\implies n \\leq \\frac{546}{73} \\approx 7.48\n\\]\nThus, \\( n \\) can take values 0 through 7.\n\nStep 6: We also need \\( m \\) to be less than or equal to 73, which gives:\n\\[\n546 - 73n \\leq 73 \\implies 546 - 73 \\leq 73n \\implies 473 \\leq 73n \\implies n \\geq \\frac{473}{73} \\approx 6.48\n\\]\nThus, \\( n \\) can only be 7.\n\nStep 7: Substitute \\( n = 7 \\) back into the equation for \\( m \\):\n\\[\nm = 546 - 73 \\cdot 7 = 546 - 511 = 35\n\\]\nThis means that 35 of the terms must be \\( 8 \\) (i.e., \\( n + 1 \\)).\n\nStep 8: The first term where \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\) occurs when:\n\\[\nr + \\frac{57}{100} \\geq 8 \\implies r \\geq 8 - 0.57 = 7.43\n\\]\nThe last term where \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{91}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\) occurs when:\n\\[\nr + \\frac{91}{100} < 9 \\implies r < 9 - 0.91 = 8.09\n\\]\n\nStep 9: Thus, we have:\n\\[\n7.43 \\leq r < 8.09\n\\]\nMultiplying through by 100 gives:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 809\n\\]\nThus, \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$ Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$.

(For real $x^{}_{}$, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the [[floor function|greatest integer]] less than or equal to $x^{}_{}$.) Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the summation. The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us a total of \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that the floor function can only change by at most 1 for consecutive values of \\( k \\). Therefore, the values of \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) can either be \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( n = \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\). Then, we can express the sum as:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=19}^{91} \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = \\sum_{k=19}^{91} (n + m_k)\n\\]\nwhere \\( m_k \\) is 0 if \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} < n + 1 \\) and 1 if \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\geq n + 1 \\).\n\nStep 4: The total number of terms is 73, so we can denote the number of terms contributing 1 as \\( m \\) and those contributing 0 as \\( 73 - m \\). The equation becomes:\n\\[\n(n)(73) + m = 546\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\n73n + m = 546\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Rearranging gives:\n\\[\nm = 546 - 73n\n\\]\nSince \\( m \\) must be a non-negative integer, we have:\n\\[\n546 - 73n \\geq 0 \\implies n \\leq \\frac{546}{73} \\approx 7.48\n\\]\nThus, \\( n \\) can take values 0 through 7.\n\nStep 6: We also need \\( m \\) to be less than or equal to 73, which gives:\n\\[\n546 - 73n \\leq 73 \\implies 546 - 73 \\leq 73n \\implies 473 \\leq 73n \\implies n \\geq \\frac{473}{73} \\approx 6.48\n\\]\nThus, \\( n \\) can only be 7.\n\nStep 7: Substitute \\( n = 7 \\) back into the equation for \\( m \\):\n\\[\nm = 546 - 73 \\cdot 7 = 546 - 511 = 35\n\\]\nThis means that 35 of the terms must be \\( 8 \\) (i.e., \\( n + 1 \\)).\n\nStep 8: The first term where \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\) occurs when:\n\\[\nr + \\frac{57}{100} \\geq 8 \\implies r \\geq 8 - 0.57 = 7.43\n\\]\nThe last term where \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{91}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\) occurs when:\n\\[\nr + \\frac{91}{100} < 9 \\implies r < 9 - 0.91 = 8.09\n\\]\n\nStep 9: Thus, we have:\n\\[\n7.43 \\leq r < 8.09\n\\]\nMultiplying through by 100 gives:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 809\n\\]\nThus, \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
