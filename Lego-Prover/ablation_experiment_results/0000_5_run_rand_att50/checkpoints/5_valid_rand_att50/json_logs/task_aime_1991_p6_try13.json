Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$. Solving shows that $\\frac{743}{100} \\le r < \\frac{744}{100}$, so $743\\le 100r < 744$, and $\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us a total of \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that since the terms can only differ by at most 1, the values of \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) can either be \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( n = \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\). Then, we can express the sum as:\n\\[\nx \\cdot n + (73 - x) \\cdot (n + 1) = 546\n\\]\nwhere \\( x \\) is the number of terms equal to \\( n + 1 \\).\n\nStep 4: Simplifying the equation gives:\n\\[\nx \\cdot n + 73 - x + x = 546 \\implies 73 + x \\cdot n = 546 \\implies x \\cdot n = 473 \\implies x = \\frac{473}{n}\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Since \\( x \\) must be an integer, \\( n \\) must be a divisor of 473. The divisors of 473 are 1, 11, 43, and 473.\n\nStep 6: Evaluate each divisor:\n- If \\( n = 1 \\), then \\( x = 473 \\) (not possible since \\( x \\) cannot exceed 73).\n- If \\( n = 11 \\), then \\( x = \\frac{473}{11} \\approx 43.91 \\) (not an integer).\n- If \\( n = 43 \\), then \\( x = \\frac{473}{43} = 11 \\) (valid).\n- If \\( n = 473 \\), then \\( x = 1 \\) (not possible since \\( x \\) cannot exceed 73).\n\nStep 7: With \\( n = 43 \\) and \\( x = 11 \\), we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of terms equal to } 44: 11 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\text{Number of terms equal to } 43: 62\n\\]\n\nStep 8: The first term where \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 44 \\) implies:\n\\[\n44 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 45 \\implies 43.43 \\leq r < 43.44\n\\]\n\nStep 9: Multiply through by 100 to find:\n\\[\n4343 \\leq 100r < 4344\n\\]\n\nStep 10: Thus, \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 4343 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
