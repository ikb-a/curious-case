It suffices to show $\\sqrt{2} \\leq x + \\frac{1}{2x}$. Let $y = \\sqrt{2}$. $y*y = 2$. Then $2x*x + 1 - 2x * \\sqrt{2} = y*y * x*x + 1 - 2xy = (xy - 1)^2 \\geq 0$. Also notice that $2x*x + 1 - 2x * \\sqrt{2} = 2x * (x + \\frac{1}{2x} - \\sqrt{2})$. Therefore $x + \\frac{1}{2x} - \\sqrt{2} \\geq 0$, given $2x > 0$. Rearranging terms, we see that the required inequality holds.\n\n## Formal statement\ntheorem\n  fixes x :: real\n  assumes \"x > 0\"\n  shows \"2 - sqrt 2 \\<ge> 2 - x - 1/ (2 * x)\"\n\n## Structured informal proof\nStep 1: Recognize that $ 2x $ is positive because $ x > 0 $.\nStep 2: Our goal is to show that $ 2 - \\sqrt{2} \\geq 2 - x - \\frac{1}{2x} $, which simplifies to $ \\sqrt{2} \\leq x + \\frac{1}{2x} $.\nStep 3: Let $ y = \\sqrt{2} $ and note that $ y^2 = 2 $.\nStep 4: Calculate $ 2x^2 + 1 - 2x \\sqrt{2} = y*y * x*x + 1 - 2xy =  (y \\times x - 1)^2 \\geq 0 $.\nStep 5: Notice that $ 2x^2 + 1 - 2x \\sqrt{2} = 2x * (x + \\frac{1}{2x} - \\sqrt{2}) $.\nStep 6: Since $ 2x^2 + 1 - 2x \\sqrt{2} \\geq 0 $ and $ 2x > 0 $, then $ x + \\frac{1}{2x} - \\sqrt{2} \\geq 0 $.\nStep 7: Rearrange the terms to arrive at the desired inequality $ 2 - \\sqrt{2} \\geq 2 - x - \\frac{1}{2x} $.\n\n## Request skills\n### Thoughts 1\nThe proof also involves inequalities that we rearrange in Steps 5-7.
