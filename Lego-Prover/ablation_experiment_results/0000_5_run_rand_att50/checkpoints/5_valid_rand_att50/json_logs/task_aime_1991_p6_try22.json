Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$.

This gives us a total of \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms in the sum.\n\nStep 2: Since the floor function can only take integer values, each term \\( \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\right\\rfloor \\) can either be \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\), depending on the value of \\( r \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( a = \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\).

(For real $x^{}_{}$, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the [[floor function|greatest integer]] less than or equal to $x^{}_{}$.) Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the summation, which is from \\( k = 19 \\) to \\( k = 91 \\). This gives us a total of \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms in the sum.\n\nStep 2: Since the floor function can only take integer values, each term \\( \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\right\\rfloor \\) can either be \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\), depending on the value of \\( r \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( a = \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\). Then, we can express the sum as:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of terms equal to } a \\cdot a + \\text{Number of terms equal to } a + 1 \\cdot (a + 1) = 546.\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Let \\( x \\) be the number of terms equal to \\( a \\) and \\( y \\) be the number of terms equal to \\( a + 1 \\). We have:\n\\[\nx + y = 73,\n\\]\n\\[\na \\cdot x + (a + 1) \\cdot y = 546.\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Substitute \\( y = 73 - x \\) into the second equation:\n\\[\na \\cdot x + (a + 1)(73 - x) = 546.\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\na \\cdot x + a \\cdot 73 + 73 - x = 546,\n\\]\nwhich leads to:\n\\[\n73a + 73 - x = 546.\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Rearranging gives:\n\\[\nx = 73a + 73 - 546 = 73a - 473.\n\\]\n\nStep 7: Since \\( x \\) must be non-negative, we have:\n\\[\n73a - 473 \\geq 0 \\implies a \\geq \\frac{473}{73} \\approx 6.5.\n\\]\nThus, \\( a \\geq 7 \\).\n\nStep 8: Now, we also need to find the maximum possible value of \\( a \\). The maximum value occurs when \\( y \\) is maximized, which means \\( x \\) is minimized. If \\( x = 0 \\), then:\n\\[\ny = 73 \\implies (a + 1) \\cdot 73 = 546 \\implies a + 1 = \\frac{546}{73} \\approx 7.48 \\implies a \\leq 7.\n\\]\n\nStep 9: Therefore, \\( a = 7 \\). This means \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor = 7 \\).\n\nStep 10: Now, we need to find the bounds for \\( r \\). The first term where \\( \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\right\\rfloor = 8 \\) gives:\n\\[\n8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01 \\implies 7.43 \\leq r < 7.44.\n\\]\n\nStep 11: Multiplying by 100 gives:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744.\n\\]\n\nStep 12: Thus, we conclude that \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
