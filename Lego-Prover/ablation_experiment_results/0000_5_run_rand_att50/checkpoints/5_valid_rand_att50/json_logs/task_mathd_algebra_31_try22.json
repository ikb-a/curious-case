The base case is trivial. Inductive case: when n is 0 it is also trivial. When $n>0$, let $m=2^n$, and we have $3^m - 1 \\equiv 4*m \\pmod{8*m}$. Then there is $k$ where $3^m - 1 = (8*m)*k + 4*m$. Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$ Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$. Therefore the inductive case holds.

This skill should make it easier to prove the base case and the inductive step.\n\n### Code 1\n```isabelle\nlemma induction_base_case:\n  shows \"(3^(2^0) - 1) mod (2^(0 + 3)) = (2::nat)^(0 + 2)\"\n```\n\n### Thoughts 2\nA strong understanding of modular arithmetic is crucial, as the proof involves manipulating modular equations.\n\n### Code 2\n```isabelle\nlemma mod_arithmetic:\n  fixes a b c d k :: nat\n  assumes \"(a - b) mod d = k\"\n  shows \"(a^2 - 1) mod (d*2) = 2 * k\"\n```\n\n### Thoughts 3\nIt will be useful to be proficient in manipulating exponential expressions, as the proof involves simplifying terms like $3^{2^{m+1}}$.\n\n### Code 3\n```isabelle\nlemma exp_simplification:\n  fixes m k :: nat\n  assumes \"3^m - 1 = 8 * m * k + 4 * m\"\n  shows \"3^(2*m) - 1 = 16 * m * (4 * m * k^2 + m + 4 * m * k + k) + 8 * m\"\n```\n\n\n####################\n\n## Problems\nGiven that  $$ \\begin{align*}x_{1}&=211,\\\\ x_{2}&=375,\\\\ x_{3}&=420,\\\\ x_{4}&=523,\\ \\text{and}\\\\ x_{n}&=x_{n-1}-x_{n-2}+x_{n-3}-x_{n-4}\\ \\text{when}\\ n\\geq5, \\end{align*} $$  find the value of $x_{531}+x_{753}+x_{975}$.

Since $531 = 106 \\cdot 5 + 1,\\ 753 = 150 \\cdot 5 + 3,\\ 975 = 194 \\cdot 5 + 5$, it follows that  $$x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975} = (-1)^{106} x_1 + (-1)^{150} x_3 + (-1)^{194} x_5 = 211 + 420 + 267 = 898.$$\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem\n  fixes x :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> int\"\n  assumes h0 : \"x 1 = 211\"\n    and h1 : \"x 2 = 375\"\n    and h2 : \"x 3 = 420\"\n    and h3 : \"x 4 = 523\"\n    and h4 : \"\\<And>(n::nat).
