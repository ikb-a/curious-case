Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$ Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$.

Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$.
