We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer.

If their teacher puts them in groups of 8, the last group has 5 students. If their teacher instead puts them in groups of 6, the last group has 3 students. What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: We start with the congruences given by the problem: \\( N \\equiv 5 \\mod 8 \\) and \\( N \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\).\n\nStep 2: From the first congruence, we can express \\( N \\) in the form \\( N = 8k + 5 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nStep 3: Substitute \\( N = 8k + 5 \\) into the second congruence \\( N \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\):\n\\[\n8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6.\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Simplifying \\( 8k + 5 \\mod 6 \\):\n\\[\n8 \\equiv 2 \\mod 6 \\implies 2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6.\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k \\equiv 3 - 5 \\equiv -2 \\equiv 4 \\mod 6.\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Dividing both sides of \\( 2k \\equiv 4 \\mod 6 \\) by 2 (noting that 2 has an inverse modulo 6):\n\\[\nk \\equiv 2 \\mod 3.\n\\]\nThus, we can express \\( k \\) as \\( k = 3m + 2 \\) for some integer \\( m \\).\n\nStep 6: Substitute back into the expression for \\( N \\):\n\\[\nN = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21.\n\\]\n\nStep 7: Now we need to find values of \\( N \\) such that \\( N < 50 \\):\n\\[\n24m + 21 < 50 \\implies 24m < 29 \\implies m < \\frac{29}{24} \\implies m = 0.\n\\]\nThus, for \\( m = 0 \\), we have \\( N = 21 \\).\n\nStep 8: Check the next integer \\( m = 1 \\):\n\\[\nN = 24(1) + 21 = 45.\n\\]\nThis is also less than 50.\n\nStep 9: For \\( m = 2 \\):\n\\[\nN = 24(2) + 21 = 69,\n\\]\nwhich exceeds 50.\n\nStep 10: The valid values of \\( N \\) are \\( 21 \\) and \\( 45 \\). Their sum is:\n\\[\n21 + 45 = 66.\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n```\n\n## Proof", "action_agent_ai0": "```isabelle\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_149\n  imports Complex_Main \"HOL-Library.Sum_of_Squares\"\nbegin\n\n(* Lemma to express N in terms of k for the first congruence *)\nlemma express_N:\n  fixes N :: nat and k :: nat\n  assumes \"N = 8 * k + 5\"\n  shows \"N mod 8 = 5\"\nproof -\n  have \"N mod 8 = (8 * k + 5) mod 8\" using assms by simp\n  also have \"... = (8 * k mod 8 + 5 mod 8)\" by auto\n  also have \"... = (0 + 5) mod 8\" by auto\n  also have \"... = 5\" by simp\n  finally show \"N mod 8 = 5\" by simp\nqed\n\n(* Lemma to express N in terms of m for the second congruence *)\nlemma express_N_mod_6:\n  fixes N :: nat and m :: nat\n  assumes \"N = 24 * m + 21\"\n  shows \"N mod 6 = 3\"\nproof -\n  have \"N mod 6 = (24 * m + 21) mod 6\" using assms by simp\n  also have \"... = (24 * m mod 6 + 21 mod 6)\" by auto\n  also have \"... = (0 + 3)\" by auto\n  finally show \"N mod 6 = 3\" by simp\nqed\n\n(* The main theorem statement copied from the input *)\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\nproof -\n  (* We will find N values satisfying the two congruences *)\n  let ?S = \"{x::nat. x < 50 \\<and> x mod 8 = 5 \\<and> x mod 6 = 3}\"\n  \n  (* Start with the expression from the first congruence *)\n  have \"N = 8 * k + 5\" for k :: nat \n    by (metis less_nat_zero_code)\n  \n  (* Substitute into the second congruence *)\n  have \"8 * k + 5 mod 6 = 3\" \n    unfolding mod_def \n    using express_N_mod_6[of \"8 * k + 5\"] by auto\n  \n  (* Simplifying the congruence *)\n  have \"2k + 5 mod 6 = 3\" \n    unfolding mod_def \n    by (metis (no_types, lifting) add.commute add_diff_eq diff_add_eq diff_le_eq_iff_le le_add_less_inverse nat_add_eq_0_iff nat_diff_split)\n  \n  (* Reducing to simpler terms *)\n  have \"2k \u2261 -2 mod 6\" \n    by simp\n  hence \"2k \u2261 4 mod 6\" \n    by (metis (no_types, lifting) add.commute add_diff_eq)\n\n  (* Dividing both sides by 2 *)\n  have \"k \u2261 2 mod 3\" \n    by (metis less_numeral_extra(1) mod_eq_0_iff_dvd)\n  \n  (* Express k in terms of m *)\n  have \"k = 3m + 2\" for m :: nat\n    by (metis (no_types, lifting) mod_eq_0_iff_dvd)\n\n  (* Substitute back into the expression for N *)\n  have \"N = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21\"\n\n  (* Finding valid values of N such that N < 50 *)\n  have \"24m + 21 < 50 \\<Longrightarrow> 24m < 29 \\<Longrightarrow> m < 29 / 24\" \n    by auto\n  hence \"m = 0 \\<or> m = 1\" \n    by (metis divide_less_iff less_Suc_eq_le_nat)\n\n  (* Calculate N for valid m values *)\n  have \"N = 21\" when \"m = 0\" using that by auto\n  have \"N = 45\" when \"m = 1\" using that by auto\n\n  (* The valid values of N are 21 and 45 *)\n  have \"sum ?S = 21 + 45 = 66\" \n    by auto\n\n  (* Conclusion *)\n  thus ?thesis by simp\nqed\n\nend\n```"}}
