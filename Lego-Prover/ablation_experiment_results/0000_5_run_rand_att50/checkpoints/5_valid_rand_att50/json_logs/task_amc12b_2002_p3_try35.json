Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$ Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$.

Therefore, we need to find when \\( (n-2)(n-1) = 2 \\). *)\n  have \"prime ((n - 2) * (n - 1)) \u27f9 (n - 2) * (n - 1) = 2\" using prime by auto\n\n  (* Step 5: Set up the equations based on the factorization: *)\n  (* Case 1: \\( n - 2 = 1 \\) and \\( n - 1 = 2 \\) leads to \\( n = 3 \\). *)\n  (* Case 2: \\( n - 2 = 2 \\) and \\( n - 1 = 1 \\) leads to \\( n = 3 \\) again. *)\n  (* Case 3: \\( n - 2 = 2 \\) and \\( n - 1 = 0 \\) is not valid since \\( n \\) must be positive. *)\n  \n  have case1: \"n - 2 = 1 \u27f9 n - 1 = 2\" by auto\n  have case2: \"n - 2 = 2 \u27f9 n - 1 = 1\" by auto\n  have case3: \"n - 2 = 0 \u27f9 n = 2\" by auto\n\n  (* Solving the cases: *)\n  {\n    assume \"n - 2 = 1\"\n    hence \"n = 3\" by auto\n  }\n  {\n    assume \"n - 2 = 2\"\n    hence \"n = 4\" by auto\n  }\n  \n  (* Step 6: Check if there are any other positive integers \\( n \\) that satisfy \\( (n-2)(n-1) = 2 \\).
