We can rewrite it as \\( (n-2)(n-1) \\).\n\nStep 2: Analyze the factors \\( n-1 \\) and \\( n-2 \\). Since \\( n \\) is a positive integer, both \\( n-1 \\) and \\( n-2 \\) are non-negative integers. \n\nStep 3: Note that one of the factors \\( (n-1) \\) or \\( (n-2) \\) is odd and the other is even. The product of an even number and an odd number is even.\n\nStep 4: The only even prime number is \\( 2 \\). Therefore, we need to find when \\( (n-2)(n-1) = 2 \\).\n\nStep 5: Set up the equation \\( (n-2)(n-1) = 2 \\). The pairs of factors of \\( 2 \\) are \\( (1, 2) \\) and \\( (2, 1) \\).\n\nStep 6: Solve for \\( n \\):\n- For \\( n-2 = 1 \\) and \\( n-1 = 2 \\): \n  - This gives \\( n = 3 \\).\n- For \\( n-2 = 2 \\) and \\( n-1 = 1 \\): \n  - This gives \\( n = 3 \\) again.\n\nStep 7: Check if there are any other positive integers \\( n \\) that satisfy \\( (n-2)(n-1) = 2 \\). Since both factors must be positive integers, the only solution is \\( n = 3 \\).\n\nStep 8: Conclude that there is exactly one positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( n^2 - 3n + 2 \\) is a prime number, which is \\( n = 3 \\). Thus, the answer is \\( \\mathrm{(B)}\\ \\text{one} \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem amc12b_2002_p3:\n  fixes n ::nat\n  assumes \"n>0\"\n    and prime:\"prime (n^2+2-3*n)\"\n  shows \"n=3\"\n```\n\n## Proof"}}
