This skill is a mathematical property that can be used to simplify expressions involving division and multiplication. If you have an equation of the form "a + b / x = c" for some real numbers a, b, c, and x (where x > 0), you can use this skill to transform the equation into "a * x + b = c * x". This can be useful in many mathematical proofs where simplification of expressions is required.
