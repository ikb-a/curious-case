Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$.

(For real $x^{}_{}$, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the [[floor function|greatest integer]] less than or equal to $x^{}_{}$.) Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Define the sequence of terms as \\( \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\right\\rfloor \\) for \\( k = 19, 20, \\ldots, 91 \\). This gives us a total of \\( 73 \\) terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that since the floor function can only change by at most \\( 1 \\) for consecutive values of \\( k \\), the terms can either be \\( 7 \\) or \\( 8 \\).\n\nStep 3: Calculate the average of the terms: \\( \\frac{546}{73} = 7 \\) with a remainder of \\( 35 \\). This indicates that \\( 35 \\) of the terms must be \\( 8 \\) and the remaining \\( 38 \\) must be \\( 7 \\).\n\nStep 4: Identify the transition point where the first term equals \\( 8 \\). This occurs at \\( k = 57 \\), which gives us the inequality \\( 8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01 \\).\n\nStep 5: Rearranging the inequalities from Step 4 gives us \\( 8 - \\frac{57}{100} \\leq r < 8.01 - \\frac{57}{100} \\), leading to \\( \\frac{743}{100} \\leq r < \\frac{744}{100} \\).\n\nStep 6: Conclude that \\( 743 \\leq 100r < 744 \\), thus \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
