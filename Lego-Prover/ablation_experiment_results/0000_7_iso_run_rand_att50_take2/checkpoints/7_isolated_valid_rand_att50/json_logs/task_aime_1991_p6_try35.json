Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$.

(For real $x^{}_{}$, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the [[floor function|greatest integer]] less than or equal to $x^{}_{}$.) Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the summation, which is from \\( k = 19 \\) to \\( k = 91 \\). This gives us a total of \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms in the sum.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that the floor function \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) can take on values that are either \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\) depending on the value of \\( r \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( n = \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\). Then, the terms can be expressed as:\n- \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = n \\) for some \\( k \\)\n- \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = n + 1 \\) for the remaining \\( k \\)\n\nStep 4: Since the sum equals \\( 546 \\), we can express it as:\n\\[\nx(n) + y(n + 1) = 546\n\\]\nwhere \\( x \\) is the count of terms equal to \\( n \\) and \\( y \\) is the count of terms equal to \\( n + 1 \\). We know \\( x + y = 73 \\).\n\nStep 5: Substitute \\( y = 73 - x \\) into the equation:\n\\[\nx(n) + (73 - x)(n + 1) = 546\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\nxn + 73n + 73 - xn - x = 546\n\\]\nwhich leads to:\n\\[\n73n + 73 - x = 546\n\\]\nThus, we have:\n\\[\nx = 73n + 73 - 546\n\\]\nor:\n\\[\nx = 73n - 473\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Since \\( x \\) must be non-negative, we have:\n\\[\n73n - 473 \\geq 0 \\implies n \\geq \\frac{473}{73} \\approx 6.5\n\\]\nThus, \\( n \\geq 7 \\).\n\nStep 7: Now, we also need to consider the maximum possible value of \\( y \\):\n\\[\ny = 73 - x = 546 - xn\n\\]\nThis gives us:\n\\[\ny = 73 - (73n - 473) = 546 - 73n + 473\n\\]\nwhich must also be non-negative.\n\nStep 8: Solving for \\( n \\):\n\\[\n546 - 73n + 473 \\geq 0 \\implies 1019 \\geq 73n \\implies n \\leq \\frac{1019}{73} \\approx 13.95\n\\]\nThus, \\( n \\leq 13 \\).\n\nStep 9: The possible integer values for \\( n \\) are \\( 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 \\).\n\nStep 10: Testing \\( n = 7 \\):\n\\[\nx = 73(7) - 473 = 511 - 473 = 38\n\\]\nThen \\( y = 73 - 38 = 35 \\). The sum becomes:\n\\[\n38 \\cdot 7 + 35 \\cdot 8 = 266 + 280 = 546\n\\]\nThis works.\n\nStep 11: Testing \\( n = 8 \\):\n\\[\nx = 73(8) - 473 = 584 - 473 = 111 \\quad (\\text{not possible since } x + y > 73)\n\\]\n\nStep 12: Since \\( n = 7 \\) is the only valid solution, we have \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor = 7 \\).\n\nStep 13: Therefore, \\( 7 \\leq r < 8 \\) implies:\n\\[\n700 \\leq 100r < 800\n\\]\nThus, \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
