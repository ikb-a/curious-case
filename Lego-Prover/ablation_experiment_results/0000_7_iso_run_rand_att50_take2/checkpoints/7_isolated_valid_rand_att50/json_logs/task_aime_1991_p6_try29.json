Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$.

The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us 73 terms in total.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that the floor function can yield either \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = 7 \\) or \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\) since the average of the sum is \\( \\frac{546}{73} \\approx 7.48 \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( a \\) be the number of terms equal to 8 and \\( b \\) be the number of terms equal to 7. We have the equations:\n- \\( a + b = 73 \\)\n- \\( 8a + 7b = 546 \\)\n\nStep 4: Solve the system of equations. From the first equation, we can express \\( b \\) as \\( b = 73 - a \\). Substituting this into the second equation gives:\n\\[\n8a + 7(73 - a) = 546\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\n8a + 511 - 7a = 546 \\implies a = 35\n\\]\nThus, \\( b = 73 - 35 = 38 \\).\n\nStep 5: Determine the bounds for \\( r \\). The first term where the floor value is 8 occurs at \\( k = 57 \\):\n\\[\n\\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\implies 8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 9\n\\]\nThis leads to:\n\\[\n8 - \\frac{57}{100} \\leq r < 9 - \\frac{57}{100} \\implies \\frac{743}{100} \\leq r < \\frac{744}{100}\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Multiply the bounds by 100 to find \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor \\):\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744\n\\]\nThus, \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\nStep 7: Conclude that \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
