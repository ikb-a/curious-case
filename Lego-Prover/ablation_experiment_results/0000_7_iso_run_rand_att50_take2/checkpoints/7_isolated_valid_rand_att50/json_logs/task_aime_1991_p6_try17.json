The base case is trivial. Inductive case: when n is 0 it is also trivial. When $n>0$, let $m=2^n$, and we have $3^m - 1 \\equiv 4*m \\pmod{8*m}$. Then there is $k$ where $3^m - 1 = (8*m)*k + 4*m$. Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$ Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$.

Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$.

The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us a total of \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that the floor function can only change by at most 1 between consecutive terms. Therefore, the values of \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) can either be \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor = n \\). Then, we can express the sum as:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=19}^{91} \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = \\sum_{k=19}^{91} (n + m_k)\n\\]\nwhere \\( m_k \\) is 0 if \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} < n + 1 \\) and 1 if \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\geq n + 1 \\).\n\nStep 4: The total number of terms is 73, so we can denote the number of terms that contribute 1 as \\( x \\) and those that contribute 0 as \\( 73 - x \\). Thus, we have:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=19}^{91} \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = n(73 - x) + (n + 1)x = n \\cdot 73 + x\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Set the equation equal to 546:\n\\[\nn \\cdot 73 + x = 546\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\nx = 546 - 73n\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Since \\( x \\) must be a non-negative integer, we require \\( 546 - 73n \\geq 0 \\), leading to:\n\\[\nn \\leq \\frac{546}{73} \\approx 7.48\n\\]\nThus, \\( n \\) can be at most 7.\n\nStep 7: Check \\( n = 7 \\):\n\\[\nx = 546 - 73 \\cdot 7 = 547 - 511 = 35\n\\]\nThis means there are 35 terms equal to 8 and \\( 73 - 35 = 38 \\) terms equal to 7.\n\nStep 8: The first term where the value is 8 occurs at \\( k = 39 \\):\n\\[\n\\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\implies 8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 9\n\\]\nThis gives:\n\\[\n8 - \\frac{57}{100} \\leq r < 9 - \\frac{57}{100} \\implies \\frac{743}{100} \\leq r < \\frac{744}{100}\n\\]\n\nStep 9: Multiply through by 100:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744\n\\]\nThus, \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
