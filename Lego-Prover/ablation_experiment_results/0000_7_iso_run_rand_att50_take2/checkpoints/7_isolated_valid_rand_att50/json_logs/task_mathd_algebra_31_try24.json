Show that it is 512.\n\n## Informal proof\nWe first calculate that $\\log_2=1$, $\\log_4=2$, and $\\log_8=3$. Then let $c=\\log_a$ and $d=\\log_b$. We can write the equations as $\\frac{c}{3} + 2*\\frac{d}{2}=5$ and $\\frac{d}{3} + 2*\\frac{c}{2}=7$. Solving the equations and we get $c=6$ and $d=3$. Hence $a=2^6=64$ and $b=2^3=8$.

The equations become $\\frac{c}{3} + \\frac{2d}{2} = 5$ and $\\frac{d}{3} + \\frac{2c}{2} = 7$.\nStep 4: Solve the linear equations to find that $c = 6$ and $d = 3$.\nStep 5: Use the values of c and d to find $a = 2^6 = 64$ and $b = 2^3 = 8$.\nStep 6: Finally, show that $a * b = 64 * 8 = 512$ to conclude the proof.\n\n## Request skills\n### Thoughts 1\nIt would be particularly helpful to have experience solving systems of linear equations since it required to solve the linear equations in step 4.\n\n### Code 1\n```isabelle\nlemma find_a_b_value:\n  fixes c d :: real\n  assumes \n    \"c/3 + d/1 = 5\"\n    \"d/3 + c/1 = 7\"\n  shows \"c = 6 \\<and> d = 3\"\n```\n\n### Thoughts 2\nIt would be helpful for step 1 if there exists lemma that calculate the base 2 logarithms of the original bases in the equations. \n\n### Code 2\n```isabelle\nlemma log_base_to_power_equals_exponent:\n  fixes a :: real\n  assumes \"a > 0\" \"a \\<noteq> 1\" \"n > 0\"\n  shows \"log a (a^n) = n\"\n```\n\n### Thoughts 3\nIn step 5 they uses the log definition to calculate the value of a and b, which require to calculate the antilogarithm_identity which calculate the value of $b = a^c$ given $log_a b = c$\n\n### Code 3\n```isabelle\nlemma antilogarithm_identity:\n  assumes \"a > 0\" and \"a \\<noteq> 1\" and \"b > 0\" and \"log a b = c\"\n  shows \"b = a ^ c\"\n```\n\n\n####################\n\n## Problems\nFind the greatest common factor of 180 and 168.

Problems\nSuppose that $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ are three positive numbers that satisfy the equations $xyz = 1,$ $x + \\frac {1}{z} = 5,$ and $y + \\frac {1}{x} = 29.$ Then $z + \\frac {1}{y} = \\frac {m}{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are [[relatively prime]] positive integers. Find $m + n$. Show that it is 5. note: this is the type of problem that makes you think symmetry, but actually can be solved easily with substitution, and other normal technniques\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Rewrite the equation $xyz = 1$ as $\\frac{1}{z} = xy$.\nStep 2: Substitute the value of $\\frac{1}{z}$ into the equation $x + \\frac{1}{z} = 5$, resulting in $x + xy = 5$, then $x(1 + y) = 5$, then $\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{1 + y}{5}$.\nStep 3: Substitute the value of $\\frac{1}{x}$ into the equation $y + \\frac{1}{x} = 29$, leading to $y + \\frac{1+y}{5} = 29$. Solve for $y$, getting $y = 24$.\nStep 6: Substitute the value of $y$ back into the equations to find $x = \\frac{1}{5}$ and $z = \\frac{5}{24}$.\nStep 7: Find $z + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{5}{24} + \\frac{1}{24} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nStep 8: The rational $p = \\frac{1}{4}$ can be expressed as $p = \\frac{m}{n}$ where $m = 1$ and $n = 4$.
