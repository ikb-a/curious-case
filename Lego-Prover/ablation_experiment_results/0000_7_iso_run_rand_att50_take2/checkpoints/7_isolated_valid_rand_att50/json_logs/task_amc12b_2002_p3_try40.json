Find $m + n$.

Substituting into one of the given equations, we have $x+xy=5$ $x(1+y)=5$ $\\frac{1}{x}=\\frac{1+y}{5}.$ we can substitute back into $y+\\frac{1}{x}=29$ to obtain $y+\\frac{1+y}{5}=29$ $5y+1+y=145$ $y=24.$ We can then substitute once again to get $x=\\frac15$ $z=\\frac{5}{24}.$ Thus, $z+\\frac1y=\\frac{5}{24}+\\frac{1}{24}=\\frac{1}{4}$, so $m+n=005$.\n\n## Formal statement\ntheorem\n  fixes x y z :: real\n    and p :: rat\n  assumes \"0 < x \\<and> 0 < y \\<and> 0 < z\"\n    and \"x * y * z = 1\"\n    and \"x + 1 / z = 5\"\n    and \"y + 1 / x = 29\"\n    and \"z + 1 / y = p\"\n    and \"0 < p\" \n  shows \"let (m,n) = quotient_of p in m + n = 5\"\n\n## Structured informal proof\nStep 1: Rewrite the equation $xyz = 1$ as $\\frac{1}{z} = xy$.\nStep 2: Substitute the value of $\\frac{1}{z}$ into the equation $x + \\frac{1}{z} = 5$, resulting in $x + xy = 5$ then $x(1 + y) = 5$.\nStep 3: Solve for $\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{1 + y}{5}$.\nStep 4: Substitute the value of $\\frac{1}{x}$ into the equation $y + \\frac{1}{x} = 29$, leading to $y + \\frac{1+y}{5} = 29$.\nStep 5: Solve for $y$, getting $y = 24$.\nStep 6: Substitute the value of $y$ back into the equations to find $x = \\frac{1}{5}$ and $z = \\frac{5}{24}$.\nStep 7: Find $z + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{5}{24} + \\frac{1}{24} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nStep 8: The rational $p = \\frac{1}{4}$ can be expressed as $p = \\frac{m}{n}$ where $m = 1$ and $n = 4$.

Since \\( n \\) is a positive integer, both \\( n-1 \\) and \\( n-2 \\) are non-negative integers.\n\nStep 3: Note that one of the factors \\( n-1 \\) or \\( n-2 \\) is odd and the other is even. Therefore, their product \\( (n-2)(n-1) \\) is even.\n\nStep 4: The only even prime number is \\( 2 \\). Thus, we set the product equal to \\( 2 \\): \n\\[\n(n-2)(n-1) = 2.\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Solve the equation \\( (n-2)(n-1) = 2 \\). The pairs of factors of \\( 2 \\) are \\( (1, 2) \\) and \\( (2, 1) \\).\n\nStep 6: For the pair \\( (1, 2) \\):\n- Set \\( n-2 = 1 \\) and \\( n-1 = 2 \\):\n  - This gives \\( n = 3 \\).\n\nStep 7: For the pair \\( (2, 1) \\):\n- Set \\( n-2 = 2 \\) and \\( n-1 = 1 \\):\n  - This gives \\( n = 4 \\), but \\( 4-2 = 2 \\) and \\( 4-1 = 3 \\) which does not yield a prime.\n\nStep 8: Check if \\( n = 3 \\) yields a prime:\n- Substitute \\( n = 3 \\) into the original expression:\n\\[\n3^2 - 3 \\cdot 3 + 2 = 9 - 9 + 2 = 2,\n\\]\nwhich is prime.\n\nStep 9: Conclude that the only positive integer \\( n \\) for which \\( n^2 - 3n + 2 \\) is prime is \\( n = 3 \\). Thus, the answer is \\( \\text{(B)}\\ \\text{one} \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem amc12b_2002_p3:\n  fixes n ::nat\n  assumes \"n>0\"\n    and prime:\"prime (n^2+2-3*n)\"\n  shows \"n=3\"\n```\n\n## Proof"}}
