Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$.

(For real $x^{}_{}$, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the [[floor function|greatest integer]] less than or equal to $x^{}_{}$.) Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the summation, which is from \\(k = 19\\) to \\(k = 91\\). This gives us a total of \\(91 - 19 + 1 = 73\\) terms in the sum.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that each term \\(\\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\right\\rfloor\\) can take on either the value \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1\\) depending on the fractional part of \\(r\\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\(n = \\lfloor r \\rfloor\\) and denote the number of terms that equal \\(n + 1\\) as \\(m\\). Thus, the number of terms that equal \\(n\\) is \\(73 - m\\).\n\nStep 4: Set up the equation based on the sum:\n\\[\n(n + 1)m + n(73 - m) = 546\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\nn + 73m = 546\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Rearranging gives:\n\\[\nn = 546 - 73m\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Since \\(n\\) must be an integer, \\(546 - 73m\\) must also be non-negative. Thus, we have:\n\\[\nm \\leq \\frac{546}{73} \\approx 7.48\n\\]\nThis implies \\(m\\) can take values from \\(0\\) to \\(7\\).\n\nStep 7: Calculate \\(n\\) for each possible \\(m\\):\n- For \\(m = 0\\): \\(n = 546\\)\n- For \\(m = 1\\): \\(n = 473\\)\n- For \\(m = 2\\): \\(n = 400\\)\n- For \\(m = 3\\): \\(n = 327\\)\n- For \\(m = 4\\): \\(n = 254\\)\n- For \\(m = 5\\): \\(n = 181\\)\n- For \\(m = 6\\): \\(n = 108\\)\n- For \\(m = 7\\): \\(n = 35\\)\n\nStep 8: Since \\(m\\) must be the number of terms that equal \\(n + 1\\), we can find the maximum \\(m\\) that satisfies the equation. The maximum \\(m\\) is \\(35\\) when \\(n = 7\\).\n\nStep 9: Thus, we have \\(n = 7\\) and \\(m = 35\\). This means \\(r\\) must satisfy:\n\\[\n7 \\leq r < 8\n\\]\n\nStep 10: To find \\(\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor\\), we calculate:\n\\[\n700 \\leq 100r < 800\n\\]\nSince \\(r\\) can be expressed as \\(7 + \\frac{p}{100}\\) for \\(0 \\leq p < 100\\), we find:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744\n\\]\n\nStep 11: Therefore, \\(\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743\\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

This gives us a total of \\(91 - 19 + 1 = 73\\) terms in the sum.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that each term \\(\\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\right\\rfloor\\) can take on either the value \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1\\) depending on the fractional part of \\(r\\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\(n = \\lfloor r \\rfloor\\) and denote the number of terms that equal \\(n + 1\\) as \\(m\\). Thus, the number of terms that equal \\(n\\) is \\(73 - m\\).\n\nStep 4: Set up the equation based on the sum:\n\\[\n(n + 1)m + n(73 - m) = 546\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\nn + 73m = 546\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Rearranging gives:\n\\[\nn = 546 - 73m\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Since \\(n\\) must be an integer, \\(546 - 73m\\) must also be non-negative. Thus, we have:\n\\[\nm \\leq \\frac{546}{73} \\approx 7.48\n\\]\nThis implies \\(m\\) can take values from \\(0\\) to \\(7\\).\n\nStep 7: Calculate \\(n\\) for each possible \\(m\\):\n- For \\(m = 0\\): \\(n = 546\\)\n- For \\(m = 1\\): \\(n = 473\\)\n- For \\(m = 2\\): \\(n = 400\\)\n- For \\(m = 3\\): \\(n = 327\\)\n- For \\(m = 4\\): \\(n = 254\\)\n- For \\(m = 5\\): \\(n = 181\\)\n- For \\(m = 6\\): \\(n = 108\\)\n- For \\(m = 7\\): \\(n = 35\\)\n\nStep 8: Since \\(m\\) must be the number of terms that equal \\(n + 1\\), we can find the maximum \\(m\\) that satisfies the equation. The maximum \\(m\\) is \\(35\\) when \\(n = 7\\).\n\nStep 9: Thus, we have \\(n = 7\\) and \\(m = 35\\). This means \\(r\\) must satisfy:\n\\[\n7 \\leq r < 8\n\\]\n\nStep 10: To find \\(\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor\\), we calculate:\n\\[\n700 \\leq 100r < 800\n\\]\nSince \\(r\\) can be expressed as \\(7 + \\frac{p}{100}\\) for \\(0 \\leq p < 100\\), we find:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744\n\\]\n\nStep 11: Therefore, \\(\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743\\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
