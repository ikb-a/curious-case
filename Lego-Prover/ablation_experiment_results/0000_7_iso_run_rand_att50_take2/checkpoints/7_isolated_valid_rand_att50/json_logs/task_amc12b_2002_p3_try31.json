We can write the equations as $\\frac{c}{3} + 2*\\frac{d}{2}=5$ and $\\frac{d}{3} + 2*\\frac{c}{2}=7$. Solving the equations and we get $c=6$ and $d=3$. Hence $a=2^6=64$ and $b=2^3=8$.

The base case is trivial. Inductive case: when n is 0 it is also trivial. When $n>0$, let $m=2^n$, and we have $3^m - 1 \\equiv 4*m \\pmod{8*m}$. Then there is $k$ where $3^m - 1 = (8*m)*k + 4*m$. Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$ Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$.

We can rewrite it as \\( (n-2)(n-1) \\).\n\nStep 2: Analyze the factors \\( n-1 \\) and \\( n-2 \\). Since \\( n \\) is a positive integer, both \\( n-1 \\) and \\( n-2 \\) are non-negative integers.\n\nStep 3: Note that one of the factors \\( n-1 \\) or \\( n-2 \\) is odd and the other is even. The product of an even number and an odd number is even.\n\nStep 4: The only even prime number is \\( 2 \\). Therefore, we need to find when \\( (n-2)(n-1) = 2 \\).\n\nStep 5: Set up the equations based on the factorization:\n- Case 1: \\( n-2 = 1 \\) and \\( n-1 = 2 \\) leads to \\( n = 3 \\).\n- Case 2: \\( n-2 = 2 \\) and \\( n-1 = 1 \\) leads to \\( n = 3 \\) again.\n- Case 3: \\( n-2 = 2 \\) and \\( n-1 = 0 \\) is not valid since \\( n \\) must be positive.\n\nStep 6: Conclude that the only positive integer \\( n \\) for which \\( n^2 - 3n + 2 \\) is prime is \\( n = 3 \\).\n\nStep 7: Therefore, the answer is \\( \\mathrm{(B)}\\ \\text{one} \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem amc12b_2002_p3:\n  fixes n ::nat\n  assumes \"n>0\"\n    and prime:\"prime (n^2+2-3*n)\"\n  shows \"n=3\"\n```\n\n## Proof"}}
