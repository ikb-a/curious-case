The base case is trivial. Inductive case: when n is 0 it is also trivial. When $n>0$, let $m=2^n$, and we have $3^m - 1 \\equiv 4*m \\pmod{8*m}$. Then there is $k$ where $3^m - 1 = (8*m)*k + 4*m$. Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$ Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$.

We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer.

Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: We start with the congruences given in the problem: \\( N \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8} \\) and \\( N \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6} \\).\n\nStep 2: From the first congruence, we can express \\( N \\) in the form:\n\\[\nN = 8k + 5\n\\]\nfor some integer \\( k \\).\n\nStep 3: Substitute this expression into the second congruence:\n\\[\n8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6}\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6}\n\\]\nwhich further simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k \\equiv -2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{6}\n\\]\nDividing both sides by 2 gives:\n\\[\nk \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}\n\\]\n\nStep 4: We can express \\( k \\) in terms of another integer \\( m \\):\n\\[\nk = 3m + 2\n\\]\nfor some integer \\( m \\).\n\nStep 5: Substitute back into the expression for \\( N \\):\n\\[\nN = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Now we need to find values of \\( N \\) that are less than 50:\n\\[\n24m + 21 < 50\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n24m < 29 \\implies m < \\frac{29}{24} \\implies m \\leq 1\n\\]\n\nStep 7: The possible values for \\( m \\) are \\( 0 \\) and \\( 1 \\):\n- For \\( m = 0 \\): \n\\[\nN = 24(0) + 21 = 21\n\\]\n- For \\( m = 1 \\): \n\\[\nN = 24(1) + 21 = 45\n\\]\n\nStep 8: The valid values of \\( N \\) are \\( 21 \\) and \\( 45 \\). Their sum is:\n\\[\n21 + 45 = 66\n\\]\n\nStep 9: Conclude that the sum of all possible values of \\( N \\) is \\( 66 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n```\n\n## Proof", "action_agent_ai0": "```isabelle\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_149\n  imports Complex_Main\nbegin\n\n(* lemma 1.
