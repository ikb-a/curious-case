We can write the equations as $\\frac{c}{3} + 2*\\frac{d}{2}=5$ and $\\frac{d}{3} + 2*\\frac{c}{2}=7$. Solving the equations and we get $c=6$ and $d=3$. Hence $a=2^6=64$ and $b=2^3=8$.

If their teacher puts them in groups of 8, the last group has 5 students. If their teacher instead puts them in groups of 6, the last group has 3 students. What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nWe are given that $N\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $N\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$.  We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer. Thus the 2 solutions less than $50$ are 21 and $21+24(1) = 45$, and their sum is $21+45=66$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50

If their teacher puts them in groups of 8, the last group has 5 students. If their teacher instead puts them in groups of 6, the last group has 3 students. What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: We start with the congruences given in the problem: \\( N \\equiv 5 \\mod 8 \\) and \\( N \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\).\n\nStep 2: From the first congruence, we can express \\( N \\) in the form \\( N = 8k + 5 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nStep 3: Substitute \\( N \\) from Step 2 into the second congruence:\n\\[\n8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6.\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6.\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Rearranging gives:\n\\[\n2k \\equiv -2 \\mod 6 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 2k \\equiv 4 \\mod 6.\n\\]\nDividing through by 2 (noting that 2 and 6 are coprime), we have:\n\\[\nk \\equiv 2 \\mod 3.\n\\]\n\nStep 5: This means \\( k \\) can be expressed as \\( k = 3m + 2 \\) for some integer \\( m \\).\n\nStep 6: Substitute back into the expression for \\( N \\):\n\\[\nN = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21.\n\\]\n\nStep 7: We need \\( N < 50 \\), so we solve:\n\\[\n24m + 21 < 50 \\implies 24m < 29 \\implies m < \\frac{29}{24} \\implies m \\leq 1.\n\\]\n\nStep 8: The possible values for \\( m \\) are \\( 0 \\) and \\( 1 \\):\n- For \\( m = 0 \\): \\( N = 21 \\).\n- For \\( m = 1 \\): \\( N = 45 \\).\n\nStep 9: The valid values of \\( N \\) are \\( 21 \\) and \\( 45 \\).\n\nStep 10: Finally, we compute the sum of all possible values of \\( N \\):\n\\[\n21 + 45 = 66.\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n```\n\n## Proof", "action_agent_ai0": "```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\nproof -\n  (* Step 1: We start with the congruences given in the problem: \\( N \\equiv 5 \\mod 8 \\) and \\( N \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\). *)\n  \n  (* Step 2: From the first congruence, we can express \\( N \\) in the form \\( N = 8k + 5 \\) for some integer \\( k \\). *)\n  define N where \"N = (8 * k + 5)\" for k :: nat\n\n  (* Step 3: Substitute \\( N \\) from Step 2 into the second congruence: \\( 8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\). *)\n  have \"N mod 6 = (8 * k + 5) mod 6\"\n    using N_def by simp\n  \n  (* Step 4: This simplifies to \\( 2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\). *)\n  have \"2 * k + 5 mod 6 = 3\"\n    by (simp add: mod_simps)\n\n  (* Step 5: Rearranging gives \\( 2k \\equiv -2 \\mod 6 \\) or \\( 2k \\equiv 4 \\mod 6 \\). *)\n  have \"2 * k \u2261 4 mod 6\"\n    by simp\n\n  (* Step 6: Dividing through by 2 (noting that 2 and 6 are coprime), we have \\( k \\equiv 2 \\mod 3 \\). *)\n  have \"k mod 3 = 2\" by (simp add: mod_divide_eq)\n\n  (* Step 7: This means \\( k \\) can be expressed as \\( k = 3m + 2 \\) for some integer \\( m \\). *)\n  define m where \"k = 3 * m + 2\"\n\n  (* Step 8: Substitute back into the expression for \\( N \\): \\( N = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 21 \\). *)\n  have \"N = 24 * m + 21\"\n    using m_def by (simp add: N_def)\n\n  (* Step 9: We need \\( N < 50 \\), so we solve: \\( 24m + 21 < 50 \\). *)\n  have \"24 * m + 21 < 50 \\<Longrightarrow> 24 * m < 29 \\<Longrightarrow> m < 29 / 24\"\n    by simp\n\n  (* Step 10: This gives \\( m \\leq 1 \\). *)\n  have \"m \\<le> 1\" using less_imp_le by simp\n\n  (* Step 11: The possible values for \\( m \\) are \\( 0 \\) and \\( 1 \\): *)\n  have \"m = 0 \\<Longrightarrow> N = 21\" by (metis m_def)\n  have \"m = 1 \\<Longrightarrow> N = 45\" by (metis m_def)\n\n  (* Step 12: The valid values of \\( N \\) are \\( 21 \\) and \\( 45 \\). *)\n  have \"N = {21, 45}\"\n\n  (* Step 13: Finally, we compute the sum of all possible values of \\( N \\): \\( 21 + 45 = 66 \\). *)\n  have \"(\\<Sum>k\\<in>{21, 45}. k) = 66\"\n    by simp\n\n  show ?thesis\n    using `(\\<Sum>k\\<in>{21, 45}. k) = 66` by simp\nqed\n```"}}
