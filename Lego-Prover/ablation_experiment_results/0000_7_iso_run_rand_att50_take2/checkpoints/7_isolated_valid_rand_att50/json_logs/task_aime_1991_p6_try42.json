Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$. Solving shows that $\\frac{743}{100} \\le r < \\frac{744}{100}$, so $743\\le 100r < 744$, and $\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us 73 terms.\n\nStep 2: Since the floor function can only change by at most 1 for consecutive values of \\( k \\), the values of \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) can either be \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( n = \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\). Then, we can express the sum as:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=19}^{91} \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = m(n + 1) + (73 - m)n = 546\n\\]\nwhere \\( m \\) is the number of terms that equal \\( n + 1 \\).\n\nStep 4: The total number of terms is 73, so we have:\n\\[\nm + (73 -

Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the summation. The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us 73 terms.\n\nStep 2: Since the floor function can only change by at most 1 for consecutive values of \\( k \\), the values of \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) can either be \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( n = \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\). Then, we can express the sum as:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=19}^{91} \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = m(n + 1) + (73 - m)n = 546\n\\]\nwhere \\( m \\) is the number of terms that equal \\( n + 1 \\).\n\nStep 4: The total number of terms is 73, so we have:\n\\[\nm + (73 - m) = 73\n\\]\nThis leads to:\n\\[\nm(n + 1) + (73 - m)n = 546\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\nmn + m + 73n - mn = 546\n\\]\nThus:\n\\[\nm + 73n = 546\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Rearranging gives:\n\\[\nm = 546 - 73n\n\\]\nSince \\( m \\) must be a non-negative integer, we require:\n\\[\n546 - 73n \\geq 0 \\implies n \\leq \\frac{546}{73} \\approx 7.48\n\\]\nThus, \\( n \\) can take values 0 through 7.\n\nStep 6: We also need \\( m \\) to be less than or equal to 73, which gives:\n\\[\n546 - 73n \\leq 73 \\implies 546 - 73 \\leq 73n \\implies 473 \\leq 73n \\implies n \\geq \\frac{473}{73} \\approx 6.48\n\\]\nThus, \\( n \\) can only be 7.\n\nStep 7: Substitute \\( n = 7 \\) back into the equation for \\( m \\):\n\\[\nm = 546 - 73 \\cdot 7 = 546 - 511 = 35\n\\]\nThis means there are 35 terms equal to 8 and \\( 73 - 35 = 38 \\) terms equal to 7.\n\nStep 8: The first term where the value is 8 occurs at \\( k = 39 \\):\n\\[\n\\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\implies 8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 9\n\\]\nThis leads to:\n\\[\n8 - \\frac{57}{100} \\leq r < 9 - \\frac{57}{100} \\implies \\frac{743}{100} \\leq r < \\frac{744}{100}\n\\]\n\nStep 9: Therefore, multiplying by 100 gives:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744\n\\]\nThus, \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

(For real $x^{}_{}$, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the [[floor function|greatest integer]] less than or equal to $x^{}_{}$.) Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the summation. The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us 73 terms.\n\nStep 2: Since the floor function can only change by at most 1 for consecutive values of \\( k \\), the values of \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) can either be \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( n = \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\). Then, we can express the sum as:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=19}^{91} \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = m(n + 1) + (73 - m)n = 546\n\\]\nwhere \\( m \\) is the number of terms that equal \\( n + 1 \\).\n\nStep 4: The total number of terms is 73, so we have:\n\\[\nm + (73 - m) = 73\n\\]\nThis leads to:\n\\[\nm(n + 1) + (73 - m)n = 546\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\nmn + m + 73n - mn = 546\n\\]\nThus:\n\\[\nm + 73n = 546\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Rearranging gives:\n\\[\nm = 546 - 73n\n\\]\nSince \\( m \\) must be a non-negative integer, we require:\n\\[\n546 - 73n \\geq 0 \\implies n \\leq \\frac{546}{73} \\approx 7.48\n\\]\nThus, \\( n \\) can take values 0 through 7.\n\nStep 6: We also need \\( m \\) to be less than or equal to 73, which gives:\n\\[\n546 - 73n \\leq 73 \\implies 546 - 73 \\leq 73n \\implies 473 \\leq 73n \\implies n \\geq \\frac{473}{73} \\approx 6.48\n\\]\nThus, \\( n \\) can only be 7.\n\nStep 7: Substitute \\( n = 7 \\) back into the equation for \\( m \\):\n\\[\nm = 546 - 73 \\cdot 7 = 546 - 511 = 35\n\\]\nThis means there are 35 terms equal to 8 and \\( 73 - 35 = 38 \\) terms equal to 7.\n\nStep 8: The first term where the value is 8 occurs at \\( k = 39 \\):\n\\[\n\\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\implies 8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 9\n\\]\nThis leads to:\n\\[\n8 - \\frac{57}{100} \\leq r < 9 - \\frac{57}{100} \\implies \\frac{743}{100} \\leq r < \\frac{744}{100}\n\\]\n\nStep 9: Therefore, multiplying by 100 gives:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744\n\\]\nThus, \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
