Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$.

The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us 73 terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that the floor function can yield either \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = n \\) or \\( n + 1 \\) for some integer \\( n \\). Since the terms can only differ by at most 1, we can denote the number of terms equal to \\( n \\) as \\( a \\) and the number of terms equal to \\( n + 1 \\) as \\( b \\).\n\nStep 3: Set up the equations based on the total number of terms and their contributions to the sum:\n- \\( a + b = 73 \\)\n- \\( an + b(n + 1) = 546 \\)\n\nStep 4: Substitute \\( b = 73 - a \\) into the second equation:\n\\[\nan + (73 - a)(n + 1) = 546\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\nan + 73n + 73 - an - a = 546\n\\]\nwhich further simplifies to:\n\\[\n73n + 73 - a = 546\n\\]\nThus, we have:\n\\[\n73n - a = 473 \\quad \\text{(1)}\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Rearranging equation (1) gives us:\n\\[\na = 73n - 473\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Since \\( a \\) must be non-negative, we require:\n\\[\n73n \\geq 473 \\implies n \\geq \\frac{473}{73} \\approx 6.5\n\\]\nThus, \\( n \\) must be at least 7.\n\nStep 7: Now, substituting \\( n = 7 \\) into equation (1):\n\\[\na = 73 \\cdot 7 - 473 = 511 - 473 = 38\n\\]\nThis means \\( b = 73 - 38 = 35 \\).\n\nStep 8: For \\( n = 7 \\), we have 38 terms equal to 7 and 35 terms equal to 8. The transition point occurs at \\( k = 57 \\) (the 39th term), where:\n\\[\n\\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 8\n\\]\nThis implies:\n\\[\n8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 9 \\implies 8 - \\frac{57}{100} \\leq r < 9 - \\frac{57}{100}\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\frac{743}{100} \\leq r < \\frac{744}{100}\n\\]\n\nStep 9: Multiplying through by 100 gives:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744\n\\]\nThus, we conclude:\n\\[\n\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
