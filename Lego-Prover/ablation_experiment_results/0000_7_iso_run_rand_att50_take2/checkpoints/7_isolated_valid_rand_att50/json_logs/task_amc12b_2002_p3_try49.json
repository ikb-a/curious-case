1 \\equiv 2^{n+2} \\pmod{2^{n+3}}$.\n\n## Informal proof\nWe prove by induction on n. The base case is trivial. Inductive case: when n is 0 it is also trivial. When $n>0$, let $m=2^n$, and we have $3^m - 1 \\equiv 4*m \\pmod{8*m}$. Then there is $k$ where $3^m - 1 = (8*m)*k + 4*m$. Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$ Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$. Therefore the inductive case holds.

We have:\n\\[\nn^2 - 3n + 2 = (n - 1)(n - 2).\n\\]\n\nStep 2: Analyze the factors \\( (n - 1) \\) and \\( (n - 2) \\). Since \\( n \\) is a positive integer, both \\( n - 1 \\) and \\( n - 2 \\) are non-negative integers.\n\nStep 3: Determine the conditions under which the product \\( (n - 1)(n - 2) \\) is a prime number. A prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. Therefore, one of the factors must equal 1.\n\nStep 4: Set \\( n - 1 = 1 \\) which gives \\( n = 2 \\). In this case, \\( n - 2 = 0 \\), and the product is \\( 1 \\cdot 0 = 0 \\), which is not prime.\n\nStep 5: Set \\( n - 2 = 1 \\) which gives \\( n = 3 \\). In this case, \\( n - 1 = 2 \\), and the product is \\( 2 \\cdot 1 = 2 \\), which is prime.\n\nStep 6: Check for any other positive integers \\( n \\). For \\( n > 3 \\), both \\( n - 1 \\) and \\( n - 2 \\) are greater than 1, making their product greater than 2, and thus cannot be prime.\n\nStep 7: Conclude that the only positive integer \\( n \\) for which \\( n^2 - 3n + 2 \\) is prime is \\( n = 3 \\). Therefore, the answer is \\(\\mathrm{(B)}\\ \\text{one}\\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem amc12b_2002_p3:\n  fixes n ::nat\n  assumes \"n>0\"\n    and prime:\"prime (n^2+2-3*n)\"\n  shows \"n=3\"\n```\n\n## Proof"}}
