What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nWe are given that $N\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $N\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$.  We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer.

Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: We start with the congruences given in the problem: \\( N \\equiv 5 \\mod 8 \\) and \\( N \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\). This means that \\( N \\) can be expressed in the form \\( N = 8k + 5 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nStep 2: Substitute \\( N = 8k + 5 \\) into the second congruence \\( N \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\). This gives us:\n\\[\n8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6\n\\]\nStep 3: Simplifying \\( 8k + 5 \\mod 6 \\), we find that \\( 8 \\equiv 2 \\mod 6 \\), so:\n\\[\n2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6\n\\]\nStep 4: Rearranging gives:\n\\[\n2k \\equiv 3 - 5 \\equiv -2 \\equiv 4 \\mod 6\n\\]\nStep 5: Dividing both sides by 2 (noting that 2 has an inverse modulo 6), we find:\n\\[\nk \\equiv 2 \\mod 3\n\\]\nThis means \\( k \\) can be expressed as \\( k = 3m + 2 \\) for some integer \\( m \\).\n\nStep 6: Substitute back into the expression for \\( N \\):\n\\[\nN = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21\n\\]\nStep 7: Now we need to find values of \\( N \\) such that \\( N < 50 \\):\n\\[\n24m + 21 < 50 \\implies 24m < 29 \\implies m < \\frac{29}{24} \\implies m = 0\n\\]\nThus, for \\( m = 0 \\):\n\\[\nN = 21\n\\]\nStep 8: For \\( m = 1 \\):\n\\[\nN = 24(1) + 21 = 45\n\\]\nStep 9: Check if \\( N = 45 \\) is valid:\n\\[\nN < 50 \\text{ and } N \\equiv 5 \\mod 8 \\text{ and } N \\equiv 3 \\mod 6\n\\]\nBoth conditions hold.\n\nStep 10: The possible values of \\( N \\) are \\( 21 \\) and \\( 45 \\). Their sum is:\n\\[\n21 + 45 = 66\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n```\n\n## Proof", "action_agent_ai0": "```isabelle\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_149\n  imports Complex_Main\nbegin\n\n(* lemma 1: A lemma to express a number in terms of its congruences. *)\nlemma congruence_reduction:\n  fixes N k :: nat\n  assumes \"N \u2261 5 (mod 8)\"\n  shows \"N = 8 * k + 5\"\nproof -\n  have \"N mod 8 = 5\" using assms by simp\n  thus ?thesis by auto\nqed\n\n(* lemma 2: A lemma for simplifying congruences. *)\nlemma substitute_congruence:\n  fixes k :: nat\n  assumes \"N = 8 * k + 5\" \"N \u2261 3 (mod 6)\"\n  shows \"8 * k + 5 \u2261 3 (mod 6)\"\nproof -\n  have \"8 mod 6 = 2\" by simp\n  hence \"8 * k \u2261 2 * k (mod 6)\" by (metis nat_mult_mod)\n  thus ?thesis using assms by auto\nqed\n\n(* formal statement copy from the input *)\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\nproof -\n  (* Step 1: Start with the congruences given in the problem. *)\n  let ?N = \"{x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}\"\n\n  (* Step 2: Express N in terms of k from the first congruence. *)\n  have \"N = 8 * k + 5\" for k using congruence_reduction by blast\n\n  (* Step 3: Substitute into the second congruence. *)\n  have \"8 * k + 5 \u2261 3 (mod 6)\" using substitute_congruence by blast\n\n  (* Step 4: Simplifying gives us: *)\n  have \"2 * k + 5 \u2261 3 (mod 6)\" by (simp add: mod_add_eq)\n\n  (* Step 5: Rearranging yields: *)\n  have \"2 * k \u2261 -2 (mod 6)\" by (simp add: mod_eq_iff)\n\n  (* Step 6: This is equivalent to: *)\n  have \"2 * k \u2261 4 (mod 6)\" by (metis add_diff_cancel_right' mod_eq_iff)\n\n  (* Step 7: Dividing both sides by 2 gives us: *)\n  have \"k \u2261 2 (mod 3)\" by (simp add: mod_eq_iff)\n\n  (* Step 8: This means k can be expressed as: *)\n  have \"k = 3 * m + 2\" for m :: nat\n\n  (* Step 9: Substitute back into the expression for N: *)\n  have \"N = 8 * (3 * m + 2) + 5 = 24 * m + 16 + 5 = 24 * m + 21\"\n\n  (* Step 10: Now finding values of N such that N < 50: *)\n  have \"24 * m + 21 < 50 \u27f7 24 * m < 29 \u27f7 m < 1.208\" by simp\n  thus \"m = 0 \\<or> m = 1\" gives valid values.\n\n  (* For m = 0: *)\n  have \"N = 21\" for m using `m = 0` by simp\n\n  (* For m = 1: *)\n  have \"N = 45\" for m using `m = 1` by simp\n\n  (* Step 11: Check if N = 21 and N = 45 are valid: *)\n  have \"21 mod 8 = 5\" \"21 mod 6 = 3\" by simp_all\n  have \"45 mod 8 = 5\" \"45 mod 6 = 3\" by simp_all\n\n  (* Step 12: The possible values of N are 21 and 45.
