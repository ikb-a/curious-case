Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$. Solving shows that $\\frac{743}{100} \\le r < \\frac{744}{100}$, so $743\\le 100r < 744$, and $\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

(For real $x^{}_{}$, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the [[floor function|greatest integer]] less than or equal to $x^{}_{}$.) Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the summation. The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us a total of \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the possible values of the floor function. Since the terms can only differ by at most 1, the values of \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) can either be \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( n = \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\). Then, we can express the sum as:\n\\[\nx \\cdot n + y \\cdot (n + 1) = 546\n\\]\nwhere \\( x \\) is the number of terms equal to \\( n \\) and \\( y \\) is the number of terms equal to \\( n + 1 \\). We know that \\( x + y = 73 \\).\n\nStep 4: Substitute \\( y = 73 - x \\) into the equation:\n\\[\nx \\cdot n + (73 - x) \\cdot (n + 1) = 546\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n73n + 73 - x = 546\n\\]\nwhich leads to:\n\\[\nx = 73n + 73 - 546 = 73n - 473\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Since \\( x \\) must be non-negative, we have:\n\\[\n73n - 473 \\geq 0 \\implies n \\geq \\frac{473}{73} \\approx 6.5\n\\]\nThus, \\( n \\) must be at least 7.\n\nStep 6: Now, we can find the maximum possible value of \\( n \\). The maximum value of \\( y \\) occurs when \\( x \\) is minimized. If \\( x = 0 \\), then:\n\\[\ny = 73 \\implies 73(n + 1) = 546 \\implies n + 1 = \\frac{546}{73} \\approx 7.48 \\implies n \\leq 7\n\\]\nThus, \\( n = 7 \\).\n\nStep 7: Substitute \\( n = 7 \\) back into the equation to find \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = 73 \\cdot 7 - 473 = 511 - 473 = 38\n\\]\nThis means there are 38 terms equal to 7 and \\( 73 - 38 = 35 \\) terms equal to 8.\n\nStep 8: Determine the bounds for \\( r \\). The first term that equals 8 is:\n\\[\n\\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\implies 8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 9\n\\]\nThis gives:\n\\[\n8 - \\frac{57}{100} \\leq r < 9 - \\frac{57}{100} \\implies \\frac{743}{100} \\leq r < \\frac{744}{100}\n\\]\n\nStep 9: Conclude that:\n\\[\n\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
