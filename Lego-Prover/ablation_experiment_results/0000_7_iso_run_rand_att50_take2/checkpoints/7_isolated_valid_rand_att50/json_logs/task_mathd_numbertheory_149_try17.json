The base case is trivial. Inductive case: when n is 0 it is also trivial. When $n>0$, let $m=2^n$, and we have $3^m - 1 \\equiv 4*m \\pmod{8*m}$. Then there is $k$ where $3^m - 1 = (8*m)*k + 4*m$. Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$ Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$.

What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: We start with the congruences given in the problem: \\( N \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8} \\) and \\( N \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6} \\).\n\nStep 2: From the first congruence, we can express \\( N \\) in the form:\n\\[\nN = 8k + 5\n\\]\nfor some integer \\( k \\).\n\nStep 3: Substitute this expression into the second congruence:\n\\[\n8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6}\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6}\n\\]\nwhich further simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k \\equiv -2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{6}\n\\]\nDividing both sides by 2 (noting that 2 and 6 are coprime), we get:\n\\[\nk \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}\n\\]\n\nStep 4: We can express \\( k \\) in terms of another integer \\( m \\):\n\\[\nk = 3m + 2\n\\]\nfor some integer \\( m \\).\n\nStep 5: Substitute back into the expression for \\( N \\):\n\\[\nN = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Now we need to find values of \\( N \\) that are less than 50:\n\\[\n24m + 21 < 50\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n24m < 29 \\implies m < \\frac{29}{24} \\implies m \\leq 1\n\\]\nThus, \\( m \\) can take values 0 or 1.\n\nStep 7: Calculate the possible values of \\( N \\):\n- For \\( m = 0 \\):\n\\[\nN = 24(0) + 21 = 21\n\\]\n- For \\( m = 1 \\):\n\\[\nN = 24(1) + 21 = 45\n\\]\n\nStep 8: The possible values of \\( N \\) are 21 and 45. Their sum is:\n\\[\n21 + 45 = 66\n\\]\n\nStep 9: Conclude that the sum of all possible values of \\( N \\) is 66.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n```\n\n## Proof", "action_agent_ai0": "```isabelle\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_149\n  imports Complex_Main\nbegin\n\n(* no helper functions required in this theorem *)\n\n(* formal statement copy from the input *)\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\nproof -\n  (* Step 1: We start with the congruences given in the problem: \n     N \u2261 5 (mod 8) and N \u2261 3 (mod 6). *)\n  \n  (* Step 2: Express N in terms of k from the first congruence. *)\n  let ?N = \"8 * k + 5\"\n  \n  (* Step 3: Substitute this expression into the second congruence. *)\n  have \"8 * k + 5 \u2261 3 (mod 6)\"\n    by simp\n  \n  (* This simplifies to: *)\n  have \"2 * k + 5 \u2261 3 (mod 6)\" \n    by (simp add: mod_add)\n  \n  (* Further simplify to: *)\n  have \"2 * k \u2261 -2 (mod 6)\"\n    by simp\n  \n  (* This is equivalent to: *)\n  have \"2 * k \u2261 4 (mod 6)\"\n    by (simp add: mod_diff)\n  \n  (* Step 4: Dividing both sides by 2, we get: *)\n  have \"k \u2261 2 (mod 3)\"\n    by (metis coprime_mod_mult_2)\n  \n  (* Step 5: Express k in terms of m: *)\n  let ?k = \"3 * m + 2\"\n\n  (* Step 6: Substitute back into the expression for N: *)\n  have \"?N = 8 * (3 * m + 2) + 5 = 24 * m + 16 + 5 = 24 * m + 21\"\n\n  (* Now we need to find values of N that are less than 50: *)\n  have \"24 * m + 21 < 50\"\n    by simp\n  \n  (* This simplifies to: *)\n  have \"24 * m < 29 \u27f9 m < 29 / 24 \u27f9 m \u2264 1\"\n    by simp\n  \n  (* Thus, m can take values 0 or 1. *)\n\n  (* Step 7: Calculate the possible values of N: *)\n  let ?N0 = \"24 * 0 + 21\"\n  let ?N1 = \"24 * 1 + 21\"\n\n  (* For m = 0: *)\n  have \"N0 = 21\" by simp\n\n  (* For m = 1: *)\n  have \"N1 = 45\" by simp\n\n  (* Step 8: The possible values of N are 21 and 45.
