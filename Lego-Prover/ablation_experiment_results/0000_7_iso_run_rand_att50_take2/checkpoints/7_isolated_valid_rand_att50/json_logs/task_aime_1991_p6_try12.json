Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$.

The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us a total of \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that the floor function can only change by at most 1 for consecutive values of \\( k \\). Therefore, the values of \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) can either be \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor = n \\). Then, we can express the sum as:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of terms equal to } n \\cdot n + \\text{Number of terms equal to } n + 1 \\cdot (n + 1) = 546\n\\]\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of terms equal to \\( n + 1 \\) and \\( 73 - x \\) be the number of terms equal to \\( n \\). The equation becomes:\n\\[\n(n)(73 - x) + (n + 1)x = 546\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n73n + x = 546\n\\]\nThus, we have:\n\\[\nx = 546 - 73n\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Since \\( x \\) must be a non-negative integer, we require \\( 546 - 73n \\geq 0 \\), leading to:\n\\[\nn \\leq \\frac{546}{73} \\approx 7.48\n\\]\nThis implies \\( n \\) can be at most 7.\n\nStep 5: Now, we check the possible values of \\( n \\):\n- If \\( n = 7 \\):\n  \\[\n  x = 546 - 73 \\cdot 7 = 547 - 511 = 35\n  \\]\n  This means there are 35 terms equal to 8 and \\( 73 - 35 = 38 \\) terms equal to 7.\n\nStep 6: The first term where the value is 8 occurs at \\( k = 57 \\):\n\\[\n\\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\implies 8 \\leq r + 0.57 < 9\n\\]\nThis gives:\n\\[\n7.43 \\leq r < 8.43\n\\]\n\nStep 7: To find \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor \\):\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 843\n\\]\nThus, \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
