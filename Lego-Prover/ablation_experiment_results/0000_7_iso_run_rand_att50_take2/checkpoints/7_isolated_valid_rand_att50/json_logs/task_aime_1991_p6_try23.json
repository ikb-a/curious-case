The base case is trivial. Inductive case: when n is 0 it is also trivial. When $n>0$, let $m=2^n$, and we have $3^m - 1 \\equiv 4*m \\pmod{8*m}$. Then there is $k$ where $3^m - 1 = (8*m)*k + 4*m$. Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$ Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$.

Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nThere are $91 - 19 + 1 = 73$ numbers in the [[sequence]]. Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$. Solving shows that $\\frac{743}{100} \\le r < \\frac{744}{100}$, so $743\\le 100r < 744$, and $\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

(For real $x^{}_{}$, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the [[floor function|greatest integer]] less than or equal to $x^{}_{}$.) Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the summation. The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us a total of \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that the floor function can only change by at most 1 for consecutive values of \\( k \\). Therefore, the values of \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) can either be \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( n = \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\). Then, we can express the sum as:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=19}^{91} \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = \\sum_{k=19}^{91} (n + m_k)\n\\]\nwhere \\( m_k \\) is 0 or 1 depending on whether \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) is less than or greater than \\( n + 1 \\).\n\nStep 4: The total contribution from the constant part \\( n \\) is \\( 73n \\). Let \\( m \\) be the number of terms where \\( m_k = 1 \\). Then, the sum can be rewritten as:\n\\[\n73n + m = 546\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\nm = 546 - 73n\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Since \\( m \\) must be a non-negative integer, we have:\n\\[\n546 - 73n \\geq 0 \\implies n \\leq \\frac{546}{73} \\approx 7.48\n\\]\nThus, \\( n \\) can take values 0 through 7.\n\nStep 6: Calculate \\( m \\) for possible values of \\( n \\):\n- If \\( n = 7 \\): \\( m = 546 - 73 \\cdot 7 = 547 - 511 = 35 \\)\n- If \\( n = 6 \\): \\( m = 546 - 73 \\cdot 6 = 546 - 438 = 108 \\) (not possible since \\( m \\) cannot exceed 73)\n- If \\( n = 5 \\): \\( m = 546 - 73 \\cdot 5 = 546 - 365 = 181 \\) (not possible)\n- If \\( n = 4 \\): \\( m = 546 - 73 \\cdot 4 = 546 - 292 = 254 \\) (not possible)\n- If \\( n = 3 \\): \\( m = 546 - 73 \\cdot 3 = 546 - 219 = 327 \\) (not possible)\n- If \\( n = 2 \\): \\( m = 546 - 73 \\cdot 2 = 546 - 146 = 400 \\) (not possible)\n- If \\( n = 1 \\): \\( m = 546 - 73 \\cdot 1 = 546 - 73 = 473 \\) (not possible)\n- If \\( n = 0 \\): \\( m = 546 - 73 \\cdot 0 = 546 \\) (not possible)\n\nStep 7: Conclude that \\( n = 7 \\) and \\( m = 35 \\) are the only valid values. This means that 35 of the terms contribute 1, and the remaining 38 contribute 0.\n\nStep 8: The first term where \\( m_k = 1 \\) occurs at \\( k = 57 \\), thus:\n\\[\n8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01 \\implies 7.43 \\leq r < 7.44\n\\]\n\nStep 9: Multiply by 100 to find \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor \\):\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744 \\implies \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

(For real $x^{}_{}$, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the [[floor function|greatest integer]] less than or equal to $x^{}_{}$.) Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the summation. The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us a total of \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that the floor function can only change by at most 1 for consecutive values of \\( k \\). Therefore, the values of \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) can either be \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( n = \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\). Then, we can express the sum as:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=19}^{91} \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = \\sum_{k=19}^{91} (n + m_k)\n\\]\nwhere \\( m_k \\) is 0 or 1 depending on whether \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) is less than or greater than \\( n + 1 \\).\n\nStep 4: The total contribution from the constant part \\( n \\) is \\( 73n \\). Let \\( m \\) be the number of terms where \\( m_k = 1 \\). Then, the sum can be rewritten as:\n\\[\n73n + m = 546\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\nm = 546 - 73n\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Since \\( m \\) must be a non-negative integer, we have:\n\\[\n546 - 73n \\geq 0 \\implies n \\leq \\frac{546}{73} \\approx 7.48\n\\]\nThus, \\( n \\) can take values 0 through 7.\n\nStep 6: Calculate \\( m \\) for possible values of \\( n \\):\n- If \\( n = 7 \\): \\( m = 546 - 73 \\cdot 7 = 547 - 511 = 35 \\)\n- If \\( n = 6 \\): \\( m = 546 - 73 \\cdot 6 = 546 - 438 = 108 \\) (not possible since \\( m \\) cannot exceed 73)\n- If \\( n = 5 \\): \\( m = 546 - 73 \\cdot 5 = 546 - 365 = 181 \\) (not possible)\n- If \\( n = 4 \\): \\( m = 546 - 73 \\cdot 4 = 546 - 292 = 254 \\) (not possible)\n- If \\( n = 3 \\): \\( m = 546 - 73 \\cdot 3 = 546 - 219 = 327 \\) (not possible)\n- If \\( n = 2 \\): \\( m = 546 - 73 \\cdot 2 = 546 - 146 = 400 \\) (not possible)\n- If \\( n = 1 \\): \\( m = 546 - 73 \\cdot 1 = 546 - 73 = 473 \\) (not possible)\n- If \\( n = 0 \\): \\( m = 546 - 73 \\cdot 0 = 546 \\) (not possible)\n\nStep 7: Conclude that \\( n = 7 \\) and \\( m = 35 \\) are the only valid values. This means that 35 of the terms contribute 1, and the remaining 38 contribute 0.\n\nStep 8: The first term where \\( m_k = 1 \\) occurs at \\( k = 57 \\), thus:\n\\[\n8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01 \\implies 7.43 \\leq r < 7.44\n\\]\n\nStep 9: Multiply by 100 to find \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor \\):\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744 \\implies \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
