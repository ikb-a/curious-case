We can write the equations as $\\frac{c}{3} + 2*\\frac{d}{2}=5$ and $\\frac{d}{3} + 2*\\frac{c}{2}=7$. Solving the equations and we get $c=6$ and $d=3$. Hence $a=2^6=64$ and $b=2^3=8$.

Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$. Solving shows that $\\frac{743}{100} \\le r < \\frac{744}{100}$, so $743\\le 100r < 744$, and $\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: We start with the sum of the floor functions given in the problem statement. The sequence consists of the terms \\(\\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{19}{100} \\right\\rfloor\\) to \\(\\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{91}{100} \\right\\rfloor\\), which contains \\(91 - 19 + 1 = 73\\) terms.\n\nStep 2: Each term in the sequence can take on one of two possible integer values, either \\( \\lfloor r + k/100 \\rfloor = 7 \\) or \\( \\lfloor r + k/100 \\rfloor = 8 \\). \n\nStep 3: The total sum of these terms is given as \\(546\\). If we let \\(x\\) be the number of terms equal to \\(8\\) and \\(y\\) be the number of terms equal to \\(7\\), we have the equations:\n- \\(x + y = 73\\)\n- \\(8x + 7y = 546\\)\n\nStep 4: From the first equation, we can express \\(y\\) in terms of \\(x\\): \\(y = 73 - x\\). Substituting this into the second equation gives:\n\\[\n8x + 7(73 - x) = 546\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\n8x + 511 - 7x = 546 \\implies x + 511 = 546 \\implies x = 35\n\\]\nThus, \\(y = 73 - 35 = 38\\).\n\nStep 5: This means there are \\(35\\) terms equal to \\(8\\) and \\(38\\) terms equal to \\(7\\). The first term that equals \\(8\\) occurs at \\(k = 57\\), which gives us:\n\\[\n\\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 8\n\\]\nThis implies:\n\\[\n8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 9 \\implies 8 - \\frac{57}{100} \\leq r < 9 - \\frac{57}{100}\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\frac{743}{100} \\leq r < \\frac{744}{100}\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Multiplying through by \\(100\\) gives:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744\n\\]\nThus, we conclude that:\n\\[\n\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
