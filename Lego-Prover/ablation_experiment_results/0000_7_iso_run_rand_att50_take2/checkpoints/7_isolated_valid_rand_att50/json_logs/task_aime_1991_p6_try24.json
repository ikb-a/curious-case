Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$.

Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the summation, which is from \\( k = 19 \\) to \\( k = 91 \\). This gives us a total of \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms in the sum.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that each term \\( \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\right\\rfloor \\) can either be \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\) depending on the value of \\( r \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( n = \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\). Then, we can express the sum as:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of terms equal to } n = x \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\text{Number of terms equal to } n + 1 = 73 - x\n\\]\n\nStep 4: The total sum can be expressed as:\n\\[\nn \\cdot x + (n + 1) \\cdot (73 - x) = 546\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\nn \\cdot 73 + (73 - x) = 546\n\\]\n\\[\n73n + 73 - x = 546\n\\]\n\\[\n73n - x = 473\n\\]\nThus, we have:\n\\[\nx = 73n - 473\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Since \\( x \\) must be a non-negative integer, we require:\n\\[\n73n \\geq 473 \\implies n \\geq \\frac{473}{73} \\approx 6.5 \\implies n \\geq 7\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Now, we also need to ensure that \\( x \\) does not exceed 73:\n\\[\n73n - 473 \\leq 73 \\implies 73n \\leq 546 \\implies n \\leq \\frac{546}{73} \\approx 7.48 \\implies n \\leq 7\n\\]\n\nStep 7: Therefore, \\( n = 7 \\). Substituting back, we find:\n\\[\nx = 73 \\cdot 7 - 473 = 511 - 473 = 38\n\\]\nThis means there are 38 terms equal to 7 and \\( 73 - 38 = 35 \\) terms equal to 8.\n\nStep 8: The critical value is \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\), which gives:\n\\[\n8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01\n\\]\nThis leads to:\n\\[\n8 - \\frac{57}{100} \\leq r < 8.01 - \\frac{57}{100}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{743}{100} \\leq r < \\frac{744}{100}\n\\]\n\nStep 9: Finally, multiplying by 100 gives:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744 \\implies \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
