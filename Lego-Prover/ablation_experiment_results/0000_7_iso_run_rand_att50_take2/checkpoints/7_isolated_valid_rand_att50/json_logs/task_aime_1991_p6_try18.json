The base case is trivial. Inductive case: when n is 0 it is also trivial. When $n>0$, let $m=2^n$, and we have $3^m - 1 \\equiv 4*m \\pmod{8*m}$. Then there is $k$ where $3^m - 1 = (8*m)*k + 4*m$. Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$ Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$.

Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nThere are $91 - 19 + 1 = 73$ numbers in the [[sequence]]. Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$. Solving shows that $\\frac{743}{100} \\le r < \\frac{744}{100}$, so $743\\le 100r < 744$, and $\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us 73 terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that since the floor function can only change by at most 1 for consecutive values of \\( k \\), the values of \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) can only be either \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( n = \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\).

Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the summation. The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us 73 terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that since the floor function can only change by at most 1 for consecutive values of \\( k \\), the values of \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) can only be either \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( n = \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\). Then, we can express the sum as:\n\\[\nx \\cdot n + (73 - x) \\cdot (n + 1) = 546\n\\]\nwhere \\( x \\) is the number of terms equal to \\( n + 1 \\).\n\nStep 4: Simplifying the equation gives:\n\\[\nx \\cdot n + (73 - x) \\cdot (n + 1) = 546 \\implies 73n + 73 - x = 546 \\implies 73 - x = 546 - 73n\n\\]\nThus, we have:\n\\[\nx = 73 - (546 - 73n) = 73n - 473\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Since \\( x \\) must be a non-negative integer, we derive the inequality:\n\\[\n73n - 473 \\geq 0 \\implies n \\geq \\frac{473}{73} \\approx 6.5 \\implies n \\geq 7\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Next, we find the maximum possible value for \\( n \\). The maximum \\( x \\) can be is 73, which occurs when all terms are \\( n + 1 \\):\n\\[\n73(n + 1) = 546 \\implies n + 1 = \\frac{546}{73} \\approx 7.48 \\implies n \\leq 7\n\\]\n\nStep 7: Combining the inequalities, we find \\( n = 7 \\).\n\nStep 8: Substitute \\( n = 7 \\) back into the equation for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = 73 \\cdot 7 - 473 = 511 - 473 = 38\n\\]\n\nStep 9: This means there are 38 terms equal to 8 and \\( 73 - 38 = 35 \\) terms equal to 7. \n\nStep 10: The critical value is \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\), which implies:\n\\[\n8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01 \\implies 8 - \\frac{57}{100} \\leq r < 8.01 - \\frac{57}{100}\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\frac{743}{100} \\leq r < \\frac{744}{100}\n\\]\n\nStep 11: Therefore, multiplying by 100 gives:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744 \\implies \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the summation. The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us 73 terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that since the floor function can only change by at most 1 for consecutive values of \\( k \\), the values of \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) can only be either \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( n = \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\). Then, we can express the sum as:\n\\[\nx \\cdot n + (73 - x) \\cdot (n + 1) = 546\n\\]\nwhere \\( x \\) is the number of terms equal to \\( n + 1 \\).\n\nStep 4: Simplifying the equation gives:\n\\[\nx \\cdot n + (73 - x) \\cdot (n + 1) = 546 \\implies 73n + 73 - x = 546 \\implies 73 - x = 546 - 73n\n\\]\nThus, we have:\n\\[\nx = 73 - (546 - 73n) = 73n - 473\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Since \\( x \\) must be a non-negative integer, we derive the inequality:\n\\[\n73n - 473 \\geq 0 \\implies n \\geq \\frac{473}{73} \\approx 6.5 \\implies n \\geq 7\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Next, we find the maximum possible value for \\( n \\). The maximum \\( x \\) can be is 73, which occurs when all terms are \\( n + 1 \\):\n\\[\n73(n + 1) = 546 \\implies n + 1 = \\frac{546}{73} \\approx 7.48 \\implies n \\leq 7\n\\]\n\nStep 7: Combining the inequalities, we find \\( n = 7 \\).\n\nStep 8: Substitute \\( n = 7 \\) back into the equation for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = 73 \\cdot 7 - 473 = 511 - 473 = 38\n\\]\n\nStep 9: This means there are 38 terms equal to 8 and \\( 73 - 38 = 35 \\) terms equal to 7. \n\nStep 10: The critical value is \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\), which implies:\n\\[\n8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01 \\implies 8 - \\frac{57}{100} \\leq r < 8.01 - \\frac{57}{100}\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\frac{743}{100} \\leq r < \\frac{744}{100}\n\\]\n\nStep 11: Therefore, multiplying by 100 gives:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744 \\implies \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
