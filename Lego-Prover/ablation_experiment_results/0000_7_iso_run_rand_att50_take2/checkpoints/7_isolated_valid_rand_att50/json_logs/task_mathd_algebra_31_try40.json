The base case is trivial. Inductive case: when n is 0 it is also trivial. When $n>0$, let $m=2^n$, and we have $3^m - 1 \\equiv 4*m \\pmod{8*m}$. Then there is $k$ where $3^m - 1 = (8*m)*k + 4*m$. Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$ Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$.

If $b=0$, $a^2 mod 3 = 0^2 mod 3 = 0$; If $b=1$, $a^2 mod 3 = 1^2 mod 3 = 1$; If $b=2$, $a^2 mod 3 = 2^2 mod 3 = 1$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem numbertheory_sqmod3in01d:\n  fixes a :: int\n  shows \"a^2 mod 3 = 0 \\<or> a^2 mod 3 = 1\"\n```\n\n## Proof\n```isabelle\ntheory numbertheory_sqmod3in01d\nimport Complex_Main\nbegin\n\n(* no helper function required in this theorem *)\n\n(* formal statement copy from the input *)\ntheorem numbertheory_sqmod3in01d:\n  fixes a :: int\n  shows \"a^2 mod 3 = 0 \\<or> a^2 mod 3 = 1\"\nproof -\n  (* Let $b = a mod 3$. *)\n  obtain b::int where c0: \"b = a mod 3\" sledgehammer\n  (* We know that b can only be 0, 1, or 2. *)\n  have c1: \"b \\<ge> 0 \\<and> b \\<le> 2\"\n    sledgehammer\n  (* Also, $a^2 mod 3 = b^2 mod 3$. *)\n  hence c2: \"a^2 mod 3 = b^2 mod 3\" using c0\n    sledgehammer\n  then show ?thesis\n  (* If $b=0$, $a^2 mod 3 = 0^2 mod 3 = 0$;\n  If $b=1$, $a^2 mod 3 = 1^2 mod 3 = 1$;\n  If $b=2$, $a^2 mod 3 = 2^2 mod 3 = 1$.*)\n  proof (cases \"b=0\")\n    case True\n    have \"a^2 mod 3 = 0\" using True c0 sledgehammer\n    then show ?thesis sledgehammer\n  next\n    case c3: False\n    then show ?thesis\n    proof (cases \"b=1\")\n      case True\n      have \"a^2 mod 3 = 1\" using True c0\n        sledgehammer\n      then show ?thesis sledgehammer\n    next\n      case False\n      have \"b = 2\" using c1 c3 False sledgehammer\n      hence \"a^2 mod 3 = 2^2 mod 3\" using c2 sledgehammer\n      also have \"... = 1\" sledgehammer\n      finally have \"a^2 mod 3 = 1\" sledgehammer\n      then show ?thesis sledgehammer\n    qed\n  qed\nqed\n\nend\n```\n\n\n####################\n\n## Problems\nShow that for any positive integer $n$, we have $3^{2^n} - 1 \\equiv 2^{n+2} \\pmod{2^{n+3}}$.\n\n## Informal proof\nWe prove by induction on n. The base case is trivial. Inductive case: when n is 0 it is also trivial. When $n>0$, let $m=2^n$, and we have $3^m - 1 \\equiv 4*m \\pmod{8*m}$. Then there is $k$ where $3^m - 1 = (8*m)*k + 4*m$. Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$ Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$. Therefore the inductive case holds.
