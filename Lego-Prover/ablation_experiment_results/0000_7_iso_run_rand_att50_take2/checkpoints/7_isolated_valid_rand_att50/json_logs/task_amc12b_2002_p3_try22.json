Since \\( n \\) is a positive integer, both \\( n-1 \\) and \\( n-2 \\) are non-negative integers.\n\nStep 3: Note that one of the factors \\( n-1 \\) or \\( n-2 \\) is odd and the other is even. The product of an even and an odd number is even.\n\nStep 4: The only even prime number is \\( 2 \\). Therefore, we need to set the product \\( (n-2)(n-1) = 2 \\).\n\nStep 5: Solve the equation \\( (n-2)(n-1) = 2 \\). The possible pairs of factors of \\( 2 \\) are \\( (1, 2) \\) and \\( (2, 1) \\).\n\nStep 6: For the pair \\( (1, 2) \\):\n- Set \\( n-2 = 1 \\) and \\( n-1 = 2 \\). This gives \\( n = 3 \\).\n\nStep 7: For the pair \\( (2, 1) \\):\n- Set \\( n-2 = 2 \\) and \\( n-1 = 1 \\). This gives \\( n = 4 \\), but \\( 4-2 = 2 \\) and \\( 4-1 = 3 \\) which does not yield a prime.\n\nStep 8: Check if \\( n = 3 \\) yields a prime:\n- Substitute \\( n = 3 \\) into \\( n^2 - 3n + 2 \\): \n  \\[\n  3^2 - 3 \\cdot 3 + 2 = 9 - 9 + 2 = 2\n  \\]\n  which is prime.\n\nStep 9: Conclude that the only positive integer \\( n \\) for which \\( n^2 - 3n + 2 \\) is prime is \\( n = 3 \\). Thus, the answer is \\( \\mathrm{(B)}\\ \\text{one} \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem amc12b_2002_p3:\n  fixes n ::nat\n  assumes \"n>0\"\n    and prime:\"prime (n^2+2-3*n)\"\n  shows \"n=3\"\n```\n\n## Proof"}}
