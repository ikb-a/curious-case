What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nWe are given that $N\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $N\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$.  We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer.

What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: We start with the congruences given in the problem: \\( N \\equiv 5 \\mod 8 \\) and \\( N \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\).\n\nStep 2: From the first congruence, we can express \\( N \\) in the form \\( N = 8k + 5 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nStep 3: Substitute \\( N \\) into the second congruence: \n\\[\n8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6.\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\implies 2k \\equiv -2 \\equiv 4 \\mod 6.\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Dividing the entire equation by 2 (noting that 2 and 6 are coprime), we get:\n\\[\nk \\equiv 2 \\mod 3.\n\\]\nThus, we can express \\( k \\) as \\( k = 3m + 2 \\) for some integer \\( m \\).\n\nStep 5: Substitute back into the expression for \\( N \\):\n\\[\nN = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21.\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Now we need to find values of \\( N \\) such that \\( N < 50 \\):\n\\[\n24m + 21 < 50 \\implies 24m < 29 \\implies m < \\frac{29}{24} \\implies m \\leq 1.\n\\]\n\nStep 7: The possible values for \\( m \\) are \\( 0 \\) and \\( 1 \\):\n- For \\( m = 0 \\): \\( N = 21 \\).\n- For \\( m = 1 \\): \\( N = 45 \\).\n\nStep 8: The valid values of \\( N \\) are \\( 21 \\) and \\( 45 \\). Their sum is:\n\\[\n21 + 45 = 66.\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n```\n\n## Proof", "action_agent_ai0": "```isabelle\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_149\n  imports Complex_Main\nbegin\n\n(* lemma 1: A lemma to help express N in terms of k from the first congruence *)\nlemma congruence_8:\n  fixes k :: nat\n  assumes \"N mod 8 = 5\"\n  shows \"N = 8 * k + 5\"\nproof -\n  obtain m where \"N = 8 * m + 5\" \n    using assms by auto\n  then show ?thesis by auto\nqed\n\n(* lemma 2: A lemma to help express N in terms of k from the second congruence *)\nlemma congruence_6:\n  fixes k :: nat\n  assumes \"N mod 6 = 3\"\n  shows \"N = 6 * k + 3\"\nproof -\n  obtain m where \"N = 6 * m + 3\" \n    using assms by auto\n  then show ?thesis by auto\nqed\n\n(* formal statement copy from the input *)\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\nproof -\n  (* Step 1: Express N in terms of k from the first congruence N \u2261 5 mod 8 *)\n  obtain k where \"N = 8 * k + 5\" \n    using congruence_8(1) by auto\n\n  (* Step 2: Substitute N into the second congruence N \u2261 3 mod 6 *)\n  have \"8 * k + 5 mod 6 = 3\" \n    by (metis (full_types) mod_add_right_eq)\n\n  (* Step 3: Simplify the expression 8k + 5 \u2261 3 mod 6 *)\n  have \"2 * k + 5 mod 6 = 3\" \n    using mod_add_eq[of \"8 * k\" 5 6] by auto\n  then have \"2 * k + 5 \u2261 3 mod 6\" \n    by (simp)\n\n  (* Step 4: Rearranging gives us 2k \u2261 -2 mod 6, which simplifies to 2k \u2261 4 mod 6 *)\n  have \"2 * k \u2261 4 mod 6\" \n    by (metis (full_types) add.commute)\n\n  (* Step 5: Dividing by 2 gives k \u2261 2 mod 3 *)\n  have \"k \u2261 2 mod 3\" \n    by (simp add: mod_mult_eq)\n\n  (* Step 6: Express k in terms of m *)\n  obtain m where \"k = 3 * m + 2\" \n    by auto\n  \n  (* Step 7: Substitute back to find N in terms of m *)\n  have \"N = 8 * (3 * m + 2) + 5 = 24 * m + 16 + 5 = 24 * m + 21\"\n\n  (* Step 8: Find values of N such that N < 50 *)\n  have \"24 * m + 21 < 50\" \n    by (simp)\n  then have \"24 * m < 29\" \n    by (simp)\n  then have \"m < 29 / 24\" \n    by (simp)\n  then have \"m \u2264 1\" \n    by (simp add: nat_less_le)\n\n  (* Step 9: The valid values for m are 0 and 1 *)\n  have \"m = 0 \\<or> m = 1\" \n    by simp\n  \n  (* Step 10: Calculate the corresponding N values *)\n  have \"N = 24 * 0 + 21 = 21\" \n    by auto\n  have \"N = 24 * 1 + 21 = 45\" \n    by auto\n\n  (* Step 11: The valid values of N are 21 and 45, their sum is 66 *)\n  show \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\" \n    by simp\nqed\n\nend\n```"}}
