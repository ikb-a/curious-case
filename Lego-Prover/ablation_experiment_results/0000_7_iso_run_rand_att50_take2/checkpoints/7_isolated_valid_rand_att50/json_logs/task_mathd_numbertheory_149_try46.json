If their teacher puts them in groups of 8, the last group has 5 students. If their teacher instead puts them in groups of 6, the last group has 3 students. What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nWe are given that $N\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $N\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$.  We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer. Thus the 2 solutions less than $50$ are 21 and $21+24(1) = 45$, and their sum is $21+45=66$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50

What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: We start with the congruences given in the problem: \\( N \\equiv 5 \\mod 8 \\) and \\( N \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\).\n\nStep 2: From the first congruence, we can express \\( N \\) in the form \\( N = 8k + 5 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nStep 3: Substitute this expression into the second congruence: \n\\[\n8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6.\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6.\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Rearranging gives:\n\\[\n2k \\equiv -2 \\mod 6 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 2k \\equiv 4 \\mod 6.\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Dividing through by 2 (noting that 2 and 6 are coprime), we have:\n\\[\nk \\equiv 2 \\mod 3.\n\\]\nThus, we can express \\( k \\) as \\( k = 3m + 2 \\) for some integer \\( m \\).\n\nStep 6: Substitute back into the expression for \\( N \\):\n\\[\nN = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21.\n\\]\n\nStep 7: Now we need to find values of \\( N \\) such that \\( N < 50 \\):\n\\[\n24m + 21 < 50 \\implies 24m < 29 \\implies m < \\frac{29}{24} \\implies m \\leq 1.\n\\]\n\nStep 8: The possible values for \\( m \\) are \\( 0 \\) and \\( 1 \\):\n- For \\( m = 0 \\): \\( N = 24(0) + 21 = 21 \\).\n- For \\( m = 1 \\): \\( N = 24(1) + 21 = 45 \\).\n\nStep 9: The valid values of \\( N \\) are \\( 21 \\) and \\( 45 \\). \n\nStep 10: Finally, we sum these values:\n\\[\n21 + 45 = 66.\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n```\n\n## Proof", "action_agent_ai0": "```isabelle\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_149\n  imports Complex_Main\nbegin\n\n(* formal statement copied from the input *)\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\nproof -\n  (* Step 1: Define the set of students N satisfying the given conditions. *)\n  let ?S = \"{x::nat. x < 50 \\<and> x mod 8 = 5 \\<and> x mod 6 = 3}\"\n\n  (* Step 2: We need to find the elements of this set. *)\n  have \"0 < 50\" by simp\n  then have \"N = 8k + 5\" for some integer k, as per the first condition.\n  \n  (* Step 3: Substitute into the second condition. *)\n  let ?n = \"8 * k + 5\"\n  have \"?n mod 6 = 3\" \n    by (metis (no_types, lifting) mod_diff_eq mod_mult_eq mod_nonneg)\n\n  (* Step 4: Rearranging gives: *)\n  (* 2k + 5 \u2261 3 (mod 6).
