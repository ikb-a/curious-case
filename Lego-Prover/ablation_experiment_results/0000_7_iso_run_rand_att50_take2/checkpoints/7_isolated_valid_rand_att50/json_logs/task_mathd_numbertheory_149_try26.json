What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nWe are given that $N\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $N\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$.  We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer. Thus the 2 solutions less than $50$ are 21 and $21+24(1) = 45$, and their sum is $21+45=66$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50

If their teacher puts them in groups of 8, the last group has 5 students. If their teacher instead puts them in groups of 6, the last group has 3 students. What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Start with the congruences given in the problem: \\( N \\equiv 5 \\mod 8 \\) and \\( N \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\).\n\nStep 2: Rewrite the first congruence as \\( N = 8k + 5 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nStep 3: Substitute \\( N \\) from Step 2 into the second congruence: \n\\[\n8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6.\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Simplify the equation from Step 3:\n\\[\n8k + 5 \\equiv 2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6.\n\\]\nThis leads to:\n\\[\n2k \\equiv -2 \\equiv 4 \\mod 6.\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Divide the entire equation by 2 (noting that 2 and 6 are coprime):\n\\[\nk \\equiv 2 \\mod 3.\n\\]\nThus, we can express \\( k \\) as \\( k = 3m + 2 \\) for some integer \\( m \\).\n\nStep 6: Substitute \\( k \\) back into the expression for \\( N \\):\n\\[\nN = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21.\n\\]\n\nStep 7: Now, we need to find values of \\( N \\) such that \\( N < 50 \\):\n\\[\n24m + 21 < 50 \\implies 24m < 29 \\implies m < \\frac{29}{24} \\implies m \\leq 1.\n\\]\n\nStep 8: Calculate possible values of \\( N \\) for \\( m = 0 \\) and \\( m = 1 \\):\n- For \\( m = 0 \\): \\( N = 21 \\).\n- For \\( m = 1 \\): \\( N = 45 \\).\n\nStep 9: Sum the possible values of \\( N \\):\n\\[\n21 + 45 = 66.\n\\]\n\nStep 10: Conclude that the sum of all possible values of \\( N \\) is \\( 66 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n```\n\n## Proof", "action_agent_ai0": "```isabelle\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_149\n  imports Complex_Main\nbegin\n\n(* formal statement copied from the input *)\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\nproof -\n  (* Step 1: Define the set of students N that satisfies the given conditions. *)\n  let ?S = \"{x::nat. x < 50 \\<and> x mod 8 = 5 \\<and> x mod 6 = 3}\"\n\n  (* Step 2: Find N by checking the congruences. *)\n  have \"N mod 8 = 5\" and \"N mod 6 = 3\" implies:\n    (* Rewriting the first congruence as N = 8k + 5 for some integer k. *)\n    let ?k = \"N div 8\" in\n    let ?N = \"8 * ?k + 5\"\n\n    (* Step 3: Substitute N into the second congruence: *)\n    have \"8 * ?k + 5 mod 6 = 3\" \n      (* Simplifying this leads to: 2k + 5 \u2261 3 (mod 6) *)\n      by simp\n\n    (* Step 4: This simplifies to 2k \u2261 4 (mod 6). *)\n    then have \"k mod 3 = 2\" (* Dividing by 2 since gcd(2, 6) = 2 *)\n      by auto\n\n    (* Step 5: Express k in terms of another integer m. *)\n    let ?m = \"k div 3\" in\n    have \"k = 3 * ?m + 2\"\n\n    (* Step 6: Substitute k back into the expression for N. *)\n    have \"N = 8 * (3 * ?m + 2) + 5 = 24 * ?m + 16 + 5 = 24 * ?m + 21\"\n\n    (* Step 7: Find possible values of N such that N < 50. *)\n    have \"24 * ?m + 21 < 50\"\n    proof -\n      have \"24 * ?m < 29\" \n        by simp\n      then show ?thesis\n        by (simp add: less_divide_eq)\n    qed\n    thus \"m < 1\" (* Therefore, m can take values 0 and 1. *)\n\n    (* Step 8: Calculate possible values of N for m = 0 and m = 1. *)\n    have \"N = 21\" if \"?m = 0\" \n      by (simp add: that)\n    have \"N = 45\" if \"?m = 1\" \n      by (simp add: that)\n\n    (* Step 9: Sum the possible values. *)\n    have \"21 + 45 = 66\" \n      by simp\n\n  (* Step 10: Conclude that the sum of all possible values of N is 66. *)\n  show ?thesis \n    by (simp add: Sum_empty)\nqed\n\nend\n```"}}
