Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$.

The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us a total of \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that the floor function can only take on integer values, and since the terms \\( \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\right\\rfloor \\) can differ by at most 1, the values of these terms must be either \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( n = \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\). Then, we can express the sum as:\n\\[\nx \\cdot n + (73 - x) \\cdot (n + 1) = 546\n\\]\nwhere \\( x \\) is the number of terms equal to \\( n + 1 \\).\n\nStep 4: Simplifying the equation gives:\n\\[\nx \\cdot n + 73n + 73 - x = 546\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\n73n + 73 - x = 546\n\\]\nleading to:\n\\[\nx = 73n + 73 - 546 = 73n - 473\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Since \\( x \\) must be a non-negative integer, we have:\n\\[\n73n - 473 \\geq 0 \\implies n \\geq \\frac{473}{73} \\approx 6.5\n\\]\nThus, \\( n \\geq 7 \\).\n\nStep 6: Now, we also need to consider the maximum possible value of \\( x \\). Since \\( x \\) cannot exceed 73, we have:\n\\[\n73n - 473 \\leq 73 \\implies 73n \\leq 546 \\implies n \\leq 7.48\n\\]\nThus, \\( n \\leq 7 \\).\n\nStep 7: Combining the inequalities, we find \\( n = 7 \\).\n\nStep 8: Substitute \\( n = 7 \\) back into the equation for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = 73 \\cdot 7 - 473 = 511 - 473 = 38\n\\]\nThis means there are 38 terms equal to 8 and \\( 73 - 38 = 35 \\) terms equal to 7.\n\nStep 9: The first term that equals 8 occurs at \\( k = 57 \\), so we have:\n\\[\n8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01\n\\]\nThis leads to:\n\\[\n8 - \\frac{57}{100} \\leq r < 8.01 - \\frac{57}{100}\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\n7.43 \\leq r < 7.44\n\\]\n\nStep 10: Multiplying through by 100 gives:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744\n\\]\nThus, we conclude that:\n\\[\n\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743.\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
