If their teacher puts them in groups of 8, the last group has 5 students. If their teacher instead puts them in groups of 6, the last group has 3 students. What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nWe are given that $N\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $N\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$.  We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer.

If their teacher puts them in groups of 8, the last group has 5 students. If their teacher instead puts them in groups of 6, the last group has 3 students. What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Set up the congruences based on the problem statement. We have:\n- \\( N \\equiv 5 \\mod 8 \\) (since the last group of 8 has 5 students)\n- \\( N \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\) (since the last group of 6 has 3 students)\n\nStep 2: Express \\( N \\) in terms of the first congruence:\n- Let \\( N = 8k + 5 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nStep 3: Substitute \\( N \\) into the second congruence:\n- \\( 8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\)\n- Simplifying gives \\( 2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\)\n- This reduces to \\( 2k \\equiv -2 \\equiv 4 \\mod 6 \\)\n- Dividing by 2 (noting that 2 and 6 are coprime) gives \\( k \\equiv 2 \\mod 3 \\).\n\nStep 4: Express \\( k \\) in terms of the second congruence:\n- Let \\( k = 3m + 2 \\) for some integer \\( m \\).\n\nStep 5: Substitute back to find \\( N \\):\n- \\( N = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21 \\).\n\nStep 6: Determine the possible values of \\( N \\) under the constraint \\( N < 50 \\):\n- For \\( m = 0 \\): \\( N = 21 \\)\n- For \\( m = 1 \\): \\( N = 45 \\)\n- For \\( m = 2 \\): \\( N = 69 \\) (not valid since \\( N < 50 \\))\n\nStep 7: Sum the valid values of \\( N \\):\n- The valid values are \\( 21 \\) and \\( 45 \\).\n- Their sum is \\( 21 + 45 = 66 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n```\n\n## Proof", "action_agent_ai0": "```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\nproof -\n  (* Step 1: Set up the congruences based on the problem statement. *)\n  have \"N mod 8 = 5\" and \"N mod 6 = 3\" for N :: nat\n    by auto\n\n  (* Step 2: Express N in terms of the first congruence. *)\n  let ?N = \"8 * k + 5\" for k :: nat\n\n  (* Step 3: Substitute N into the second congruence. *)\n  have \"8 * k + 5 mod 6 = 3\"\n  proof -\n    have \"8 mod 6 = 2\" by simp\n    then have \"8 * k + 5 mod 6 = (2 * k + 5) mod 6\"\n      by (simp add: mod_mult_left)\n    also have \"... = 3\" using \"N mod 6 = 3\" by auto\n    finally show ?thesis by auto\n  qed\n\n  (* Step 4: Simplify the congruence. *)\n  have \"2 * k + 5 \u2261 3 (mod 6)\"\n  proof -\n    have \"2 * k \u2261 3 - 5 (mod 6)\" by simp\n    hence \"2 * k \u2261 -2 (mod 6)\" by simp\n    thus \"2 * k \u2261 4 (mod 6)\" by (simp add: mod_add_eq)\n  qed\n\n  (* Step 5: Divide both sides by 2 to find k. *)\n  have \"k \u2261 2 (mod 3)\"\n  proof -\n    have \"k = 3 * m + 2\" for m :: nat\n      by auto\n    thus ?thesis by auto\n  qed\n\n  (* Step 6: Substitute back to find N. *)\n  have \"N = 8 * (3 * m + 2) + 5\"\n  proof -\n    have \"N = 24 * m + 16 + 5\" by (simp add: algebra_simps)\n    thus ?thesis by auto\n  qed\n\n  (* Step 7: Determine the possible values of N under the constraint N < 50. *)\n  let ?N = \"24 * m + 21\"\n  have \"N < 50 \u27f7 24 * m + 21 < 50\"\n  proof -\n    have \"24 * m < 29\" by simp\n    thus ?thesis by auto\n  qed\n\n  (* Checking values of m *)\n  have \"m = 0 \u27f9 N = 21\" by auto\n  have \"m = 1 \u27f9 N = 45\" by auto\n  have \"m = 2 \u27f9 N = 69\" by auto\n\n  (* Valid values of N are 21 and 45. *)\n  have valid_N: \"N = 21 \u2228 N = 45\" by auto\n\n  (* Step 8: Sum the valid values of N. *)\n  have \"21 + 45 = 66\" by auto\n\n  (* Conclusion: The sum of all possible values of N is 66. *)\n  thus ?thesis by (simp add: valid_N)\nqed\n```"}}
