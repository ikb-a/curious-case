Show that it is 18.\n\n## Informal proof\nWe simplify $10a + b = 2(a+b)$ to get $8a = b$. Since $a$ is at least 1, $b$ is at least 8. We know $b$ is 8 since $8a = b$ and $a$ is a natural number.

Simplify $10a + b = 2(a+b)$ to get $8a = b$.\nStep 2: Apply the constraint that $a$ is at least 1 to get that $b$ is at least 8.\nStep 3: Use the natural number condition for $a$ and $b$ to argue that $b = 8$ and $a = 1$ are the only viable solutions that satisfy the equation and constraints.\nStep 4: Conclude that the two-digit integer is $18$ as $10 * 1 + 8 = 18$.\n\n## Request skills\n### Thoughts 1\nThe solver needs to be comfortable working with Diophantine equations and natural numbers to find integer solutions for the given equation.\n\n### Code 1\n```isabelle\nlemma find_a_b_integer_solution:\n  fixes a b :: nat\n  assumes \n    \"1 \\<le> a \\<and> a \\<le> 9 \\<and> b \\<le> 9\"\n    \"10 * a + b = 2 * (a + b)\"\n  shows \"a = 1 \\<and> b = 8\"\n```\n\n\n\n####################\n\n## Problems\nDetermine the value of $ab$ if $\\log_8a+\\log_4b^2=5$ and $\\log_8b+\\log_4a^2=7$.

The base case is trivial. Inductive case: when n is 0 it is also trivial. When $n>0$, let $m=2^n$, and we have $3^m - 1 \\equiv 4*m \\pmod{8*m}$. Then there is $k$ where $3^m - 1 = (8*m)*k + 4*m$. Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$ Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$.

Since \\( n \\) is a positive integer, both \\( n-1 \\) and \\( n-2 \\) are non-negative integers.\n\nStep 3: Note that one of the factors \\( n-1 \\) or \\( n-2 \\) is odd and the other is even. The product of an even number and an odd number is even.\n\nStep 4: The only even prime number is \\( 2 \\).
