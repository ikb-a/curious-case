It suffices to show $\\sqrt{2} \\leq x + \\frac{1}{2x}$. Let $y = \\sqrt{2}$. $y*y = 2$. Then $2x*x + 1 - 2x * \\sqrt{2} = y*y * x*x + 1 - 2xy = (xy - 1)^2 \\geq 0$.

Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$ Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$.

The base case is trivial. Inductive case: when n is 0 it is also trivial. When $n>0$, let $m=2^n$, and we have $3^m - 1 \\equiv 4*m \\pmod{8*m}$. Then there is $k$ where $3^m - 1 = (8*m)*k + 4*m$. Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$ Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$. Therefore the inductive case holds.
