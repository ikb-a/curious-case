Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$. Solving shows that $\\frac{743}{100} \\le r < \\frac{744}{100}$, so $743\\le 100r < 744$, and $\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us a total of \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that since the terms \\( \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\right\\rfloor \\) can only differ by at most 1, the values of these terms must be either \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( n = \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\). Then, we can express the sum as:\n\\[\nx \\cdot n + (73 - x) \\cdot (n + 1) = 546\n\\]\nwhere \\( x \\) is the number of terms equal to \\( n + 1 \\).\n\nStep 4: Simplifying the equation gives:\n\\[\nx \\cdot n + (73 -

473 \\geq 0 \\implies n \\geq \\frac{473}{73} \\approx 6.5\n\\]\nThus, \\( n \\geq 7 \\).\n\nStep 6: Next, we also need to ensure that \\( x \\) does not exceed 73:\n\\[\n73 - (546 - 73n) \\leq 73 \\implies 546 -
