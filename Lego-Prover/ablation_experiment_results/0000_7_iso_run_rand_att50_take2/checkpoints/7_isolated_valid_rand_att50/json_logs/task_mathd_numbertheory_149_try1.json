What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: We start with the congruences given in the problem: \\( N \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8} \\) and \\( N \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6} \\).\n\nStep 2: From the first congruence, we can express \\( N \\) in the form:\n\\[\nN = 8k + 5\n\\]\nfor some integer \\( k \\).\n\nStep 3: Substitute this expression into the second congruence:\n\\[\n8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6}\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6}\n\\]\nwhich further simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k \\equiv -2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{6}\n\\]\nDividing both sides by 2 (noting that 2 has an inverse modulo 6), we get:\n\\[\nk \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}\n\\]\n\nStep 4: We can express \\( k \\) in terms of another integer \\( m \\):\n\\[\nk = 3m + 2\n\\]\nfor some integer \\( m \\).\n\nStep 5: Substitute back into the expression for \\( N \\):\n\\[\nN = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Now we need to find values of \\( N \\) that are less than 50:\n\\[\n24m + 21 < 50\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n24m < 29 \\implies m < \\frac{29}{24} \\implies m \\leq 1\n\\]\n\nStep 7: The possible values for \\( m \\) are \\( 0 \\) and \\( 1 \\):\n- For \\( m = 0 \\): \\( N = 24(0) + 21 = 21 \\)\n- For \\( m = 1 \\): \\( N = 24(1) + 21 = 45 \\)\n\nStep 8: The valid values of \\( N \\) are \\( 21 \\) and \\( 45 \\). Their sum is:\n\\[\n21 + 45 = 66\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n```\n\n## Proof", "action_agent_ai0": "```isabelle\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_149\n  imports Complex_Main\nbegin\n\n(* formal statement copied from the input *)\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\nproof -\n  (* Step 1: Establish the set of integers satisfying the conditions *)\n  let ?S = \"{x::nat. x < 50 \\<and> x mod 8 = 5 \\<and> x mod 6 = 3}\"\n  \n  (* Step 2: Start with the first congruence *)\n  have \"x mod 8 = 5\" implies \"x = 8k + 5\" for some integer k.\n  \n  (* Step 3: Substitute into the second congruence *)\n  obtain k where \"x = 8*k + 5\" for k\n    by auto\n\n  (* Step 4: Substitute into the second congruence *)\n  have \"8*k + 5 mod 6 = 3\" \n  proof -\n    have \"8 mod 6 = 2\" by simp\n    show ?thesis by (simp add: mod_add_right_eq)\n  qed\n\n  (* Step 5: Simplify the congruence *)\n  have \"2*k + 5 mod 6 = 3\" simplifies to \"2*k mod 6 = -2 mod 6\" which is \"2*k mod 6 = 4 mod 6\"\n  proof -\n    have \"5 \u2261 3 (mod 6)\" by simp\n    thus ?thesis by (simp add: mod_eq_iff)\n  qed\n\n  (* Step 6: Divide by 2 *)\n  have \"k mod 3 = 2\" implies \"k = 3m + 2\" for some integer m.\n  \n  (* Step 7: Substitute back to find N *)\n  have \"x = 8*(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21\"\n\n  (* Step 8: Find possible values of N less than 50 *)\n  have \"24m + 21 < 50\" simplifies to \"m < 1.208\" implying \"m \u2264 1\" since m is a natural number.\n\n  (* Step 9: Calculate possible values for m *)\n  have \"m = 0\" gives \"N = 21\" and \"m = 1\" gives \"N = 45\".\n\n  (* Step 10: Valid values of N *)\n  have \"N = 21\" or \"N = 45\".\n\n  (* Step 11: Sum the values *)\n  have \"21 + 45 = 66\".\n\n  (* Final conclusion *)\n  show ?thesis by (simp add: sum.atLeast_0_atMost)\nqed\n\nend\n```"}}
