Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$.

(For real $x^{}_{}$, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the [[floor function|greatest integer]] less than or equal to $x^{}_{}$.) Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the summation, which is from \\( k = 19 \\) to \\( k = 91 \\). This gives us a total of \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms in the sum.\n\nStep 2: Since the floor function can only take integer values, the terms \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) for \\( k = 19, 20, \\ldots, 91 \\) can either be \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( a = \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\). The number of terms that equal \\( a \\) is \\( 73 - b \\), where \\( b \\) is the number of terms that equal \\( a + 1 \\).\n\nStep 4: The total contribution to the sum from these terms can be expressed as:\n\\[\n(73 - b) \\cdot a + b \\cdot (a + 1) = 73a + b\n\\]\nSetting this equal to 546 gives us:\n\\[\n73a + b = 546\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Rearranging gives:\n\\[\nb = 546 - 73a\n\\]\nSince \\( b \\) must be a non-negative integer, we have:\n\\[\n546 - 73a \\geq 0 \\implies a \\leq \\frac{546}{73} \\approx 7.48\n\\]\nThus, \\( a \\) can take values \\( 7 \\) or \\( 8 \\).\n\nStep 6: If \\( a = 7 \\):\n\\[\nb = 546 - 73 \\cdot 7 = 547 - 511 = 35\n\\]\nThis means there are 35 terms equal to \\( 8 \\) and \\( 38 \\) terms equal to \\( 7 \\).\n\nStep 7: The first term that equals \\( 8 \\) occurs at \\( k = 57 \\):\n\\[\n\\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\implies 8 \\leq r + 0.57 < 9 \\implies 7.43 \\leq r < 8.43\n\\]\n\nStep 8: This implies:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 843\n\\]\nSince \\( b \\) must also be less than or equal to 73, we can conclude that \\( 100r \\) must be less than 744.\n\nStep 9: Therefore, we have:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744 \\implies \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
