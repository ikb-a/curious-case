What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Define \\( N \\) as the number of students, with the conditions \\( N \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8} \\) and \\( N \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6} \\).\n\nStep 2: From the first condition, we can express \\( N \\) in the form \\( N = 8k + 5 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nStep 3: Substitute \\( N \\) into the second condition: \n\\[\n8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6}.\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6} \\implies 2k \\equiv -2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{6}.\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Dividing both sides of \\( 2k \\equiv 4 \\) by 2 gives:\n\\[\nk \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}.\n\\]\nThus, we can express \\( k \\) as \\( k = 3m + 2 \\) for some integer \\( m \\).\n\nStep 5: Substitute \\( k \\) back into the expression for \\( N \\):\n\\[\nN = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21.\n\\]\n\nStep 6: To find valid values of \\( N \\) under the constraint \\( N < 50 \\), we solve:\n\\[\n24m + 21 < 50 \\implies 24m < 29 \\implies m < \\frac{29}{24} \\implies m = 0 \\text{ or } 1.\n\\]\n\nStep 7: Calculate the possible values of \\( N \\):\n- For \\( m = 0 \\): \\( N = 24(0) + 21 = 21 \\).\n- For \\( m = 1 \\): \\( N = 24(1) + 21 = 45 \\).\n\nStep 8: The valid values of \\( N \\) are 21 and 45. Their sum is:\n\\[\n21 + 45 = 66.\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n```\n\n## Proof", "```isabelle\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_149\n  imports Complex_Main\nbegin\n\n(* formal statement copied from the input *)\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\nproof -\n  (* Define the set of integers less than 50 satisfying the conditions. *)\n  let ?S = \"{x::nat. x < 50 \\<and> x mod 8 = 5 \\<and> x mod 6 = 3}\"\n  \n  (* First, we will enumerate the elements of the set ?S. *)\n  have \"0 < 50\" by simp\n  hence \"5 < 50\" by simp\n  \n  (* We can express N in the form N = 8k + 5 for some integer k. *)\n  let ?k = \"0..6\" (* This is because (50-5) div 8 = 5, so k can range from 0 to 6. *)\n  \n  (* Iterate over k to find possible values of N. *)\n  have values: \"set (?S) = {8*k + 5 | k. k \\<in> ?k \\<and> (8*k + 5) mod 6 = 3}\"\n  proof -\n    have \"k \\<in> ?k \\<Longrightarrow> (8*k + 5) < 50\" \n      by (metis not_less_eq_eq) (* since for k=6, N=53 which exceeds limit *)\n    \n    (* Now we check the second condition for each k. *)\n    {\n      fix k :: nat\n      assume \"k \\<in> ?k\"\n      then have \"8*k + 5 mod 6 = 3 \\<longleftrightarrow> 2*k + 5 mod 6 = 3\"\n      proof -\n        have \"8*k mod 6 = 2*k\" by simp\n        thus ?thesis by simp\n      qed\n      \n      (* Calculate the values of k that satisfy the condition. *)\n      have \"2*k + 5 mod 6 = 3 \\<Longrightarrow> 2*k mod 6 = -2 mod 6 \\<Longrightarrow> 2*k mod 6 = 4\" \n        by (metis add.commute)\n      \n      (* Solve the equation 2*k = 4 mod 6. *)\n      have \"k mod 3 = 2\" by (metis)\n      hence \"k = 3*m + 2\" for some integer m\n    }\n    thus ?thesis by auto\n  qed\n  \n  (* Now we substitute back to find the values of N. *)\n  obtain m where \"m < 2\" using values \n    by (metis)\n  \n  (* Calculate N for m = 0 and m = 1. *)\n  have \"N = 24*m + 21\"\n  hence \"N = 21\" for m = 0\n  have \"N = 45\" for m = 1\n  \n  (* Both values are valid under the condition N < 50. *)\n  have \"21 + 45 = 66\" by simp\n  \n  (* The sum of all possible values of N is 66. *)\n  show ?thesis using values by auto\nqed\n\nend\n```"]], "code": "theory mathd_numbertheory_149\n  imports Complex_Main\nbegin\n\n(* formal statement copied from the input *)\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\nproof -\n  (* Define the set of integers less than 50 satisfying the conditions. *)\n  let ?S = \"{x::nat. x < 50 \\<and> x mod 8 = 5 \\<and> x mod 6 = 3}\"\n  \n  (* First, we will enumerate the elements of the set ?S. *)\n  have \"0 < 50\" by simp\n  hence \"5 < 50\" by simp\n  \n  (* We can express N in the form N = 8k + 5 for some integer k. *)\n  let ?k = \"0..6\" (* This is because (50-5) div 8 = 5, so k can range from 0 to 6. *)\n  \n  (* Iterate over k to find possible values of N. *)\n  have values: \"set (?S) = {8*k + 5 | k. k \\<in> ?k \\<and> (8*k + 5) mod 6 = 3}\"\n  proof -\n    have \"k \\<in> ?k \\<Longrightarrow> (8*k + 5) < 50\" \n      by (metis not_less_eq_eq) (* since for k=6, N=53 which exceeds limit *)\n    \n    (* Now we check the second condition for each k. *)\n    {\n      fix k :: nat\n      assume \"k \\<in> ?k\"\n      then have \"8*k + 5 mod 6 = 3 \\<longleftrightarrow> 2*k + 5 mod 6 = 3\"\n      proof -\n        have \"8*k mod 6 = 2*k\" by simp\n        thus ?thesis by simp\n      qed\n      \n      (* Calculate the values of k that satisfy the condition. *)\n      have \"2*k + 5 mod 6 = 3 \\<Longrightarrow> 2*k mod 6 = -2 mod 6 \\<Longrightarrow> 2*k mod 6 = 4\" \n        by (metis add.commute)\n      \n      (* Solve the equation 2*k = 4 mod 6. *)\n      have \"k mod 3 = 2\" by (metis)\n      hence \"k = 3*m + 2\" for some integer m\n    }\n    thus ?thesis by auto\n  qed\n  \n  (* Now we substitute back to find the values of N. *)\n  obtain m where \"m < 2\" using values \n    by (metis)\n  \n  (* Calculate N for m = 0 and m = 1. *)\n  have \"N = 24*m + 21\"\n  hence \"N = 21\" for m = 0\n  have \"N = 45\" for m = 1\n  \n  (* Both values are valid under the condition N < 50. *)\n  have \"21 + 45 = 66\" by simp\n  \n  (* The sum of all possible values of N is 66. *)\n  show ?thesis using values by auto\nqed\n\nend", "context": {"problem_name": "mathd_numbertheory_149", "category": "unknown", "metadata": {}, "informal_statement": "A group of $N$ students, where $N < 50$, is on a field trip.
