Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$.

Then, the terms can take values \\( n \\) or \\( n + 1 \\). The total sum of these terms is given as \\( 546 \\).\n\nStep 4: Let \\( x \\) be the number of terms equal to \\( n + 1 \\) and \\( 73 - x \\) be the number of terms equal to \\( n \\). The equation can be set up as:\n\\[\nn(73 - x) + (n + 1)x = 546\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n73n + x = 546\n\\]\nThus, we have:\n\\[\nx = 546 - 73n\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Since \\( x \\) must be a non-negative integer, we require \\( 546 - 73n \\geq 0 \\), leading to:\n\\[\nn \\leq \\frac{546}{73} \\approx 7.48\n\\]\nThis implies \\( n \\) can be at most \\( 7 \\).\n\nStep 6: Now, check \\( n = 7 \\):\n\\[\nx = 546 - 73 \\cdot 7 = 546 - 511 = 35\n\\]\nThis means there are \\( 35 \\) terms equal to \\( 8 \\) and \\( 38 \\) terms equal to \\( 7 \\).\n\nStep 7: The first term where the value is \\( 8 \\) occurs at \\( k = 57 \\):\n\\[\n\\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 8\n\\]\nThis gives us:\n\\[\n8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01\n\\]\nThus:\n\\[\n8 - \\frac{57}{100} \\leq r < 8.01 - \\frac{57}{100}\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\frac{743}{100} \\leq r < \\frac{744}{100}\n\\]\n\nStep 8: Therefore, multiplying by \\( 100 \\) gives:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744\n\\]\nThus, we conclude:\n\\[\n\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
