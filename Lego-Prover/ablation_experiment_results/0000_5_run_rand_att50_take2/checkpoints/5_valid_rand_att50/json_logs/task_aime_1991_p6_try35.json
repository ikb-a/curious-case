Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$.

Then, the terms can be expressed as:\n- \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = n \\) for some \\( k \\)\n- \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = n + 1 \\) for the remaining \\( k \\)\n\nStep 4: Since the total sum is \\( 546 \\), we can express this as:\n\\[\nx(n) + (73 - x)(n + 1) = 546\n\\]\nwhere \\( x \\) is the number of terms equal to \\( n + 1 \\).\n\nStep 5: Rearranging gives:\n\\[\nx(n) + 73n + 73 - x = 546\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\n(73 - x) + 73n = 546\n\\]\nleading to:\n\\[\n73n + 73 - x = 546\n\\]\nthus:\n\\[\nx = 73n + 73 - 546 = 73n - 473\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Since \\( x \\) must be non-negative, we have:\n\\[\n73n - 473 \\geq 0 \\implies n \\geq \\frac{473}{73} \\approx 6.5\n\\]\nThus, \\( n \\geq 7 \\).\n\nStep 7: Now, we also need to consider the maximum possible value of \\( x \\). The maximum value of \\( x \\) occurs when \\( n + 1 \\) is the value for as many terms as possible. The maximum \\( x \\) can be \\( 73 \\), leading to:\n\\[\nx = 73n - 473 \\leq 73 \\implies 73n \\leq 546 \\implies n \\leq 7.48\n\\]\nThus, \\( n \\leq 7 \\).\n\nStep 8: Combining the inequalities, we find \\( n = 7 \\).\n\nStep 9: Substitute \\( n = 7 \\) back into the equation for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = 73 \\cdot 7 - 473 = 511 - 473 = 38\n\\]\nThis means \\( 38 \\) terms are \\( 8 \\) and \\( 35 \\) terms are \\( 7 \\).\n\nStep 10: The first term where \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\) implies:\n\\[\n8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01\n\\]\nThis leads to:\n\\[\n8 - \\frac{57}{100} \\leq r < 8.01 - \\frac{57}{100}\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\n7.43 \\leq r < 7.44\n\\]\n\nStep 11: Therefore, multiplying by \\( 100 \\) gives:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744\n\\]\nThus, \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
