Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$.

Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the summation. The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us 73 terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that the floor function can yield either \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor + 1 \\), depending on the value of \\( r \\). Since the terms can differ by at most 1, we can denote the number of terms that yield 7 as \\( n_7 \\) and those that yield 8 as \\( n_8 \\).\n\nStep 3: Set up the equations based on the total number of terms and the total sum:\n- \\( n_7 + n_8 = 73 \\)\n- \\( 7n_7 + 8n_8 = 546 \\)\n\nStep 4: Solve the system of equations. From the first equation, we can express \\( n_7 \\) as \\( n_7 = 73 - n_8 \\). Substituting this into the second equation gives:\n\\[\n7(73 - n_8) + 8n_8 = 546\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\n511 - 7n_8 + 8n_8 = 546 \\implies n_8 = 546 - 511 = 35\n\\]\nThus, \\( n_7 = 73 - 35 = 38 \\).\n\nStep 5: Determine the implications of these counts. The 39th term, which is the first term that yields 8, corresponds to \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor \\). Therefore, we have:\n\\[\n8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Rearranging gives:\n\\[\n8 - \\frac{57}{100} \\leq r < 8.01 - \\frac{57}{100}\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\frac{743}{100} \\leq r < \\frac{744}{100}\n\\]\n\nStep 7: Finally, multiplying through by 100 gives:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744\n\\]\nThus, we conclude that \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
