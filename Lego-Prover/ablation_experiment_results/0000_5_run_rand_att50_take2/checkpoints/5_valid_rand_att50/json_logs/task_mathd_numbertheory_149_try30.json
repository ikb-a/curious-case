What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nWe are given that $N\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $N\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$.  We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer.

If their teacher puts them in groups of 8, the last group has 5 students. If their teacher instead puts them in groups of 6, the last group has 3 students. What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Define \\( N \\) as the number of students, with the conditions \\( N \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8} \\) and \\( N \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6} \\).\n\nStep 2: From the first condition, we can express \\( N \\) in the form \\( N = 8k + 5 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nStep 3: Substitute this expression into the second condition: \n\\[\n8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6}.\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6} \\implies 2k \\equiv -2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{6}.\n\\]\nDividing both sides by 2 gives:\n\\[\nk \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}.\n\\]\nThus, we can express \\( k \\) as \\( k = 3m + 2 \\) for some integer \\( m \\).\n\nStep 4: Substitute back into the expression for \\( N \\):\n\\[\nN = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21.\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Since \\( N < 50 \\), we solve:\n\\[\n24m + 21 < 50 \\implies 24m < 29 \\implies m < \\frac{29}{24} \\implies m \\leq 1.\n\\]\nThus, \\( m \\) can be 0 or 1.\n\nStep 6: Calculate the possible values of \\( N \\):\n- For \\( m = 0 \\): \\( N = 24(0) + 21 = 21 \\).\n- For \\( m = 1 \\): \\( N = 24(1) + 21 = 45 \\).\n\nStep 7: The possible values of \\( N \\) are 21 and 45. Their sum is:\n\\[\n21 + 45 = 66.\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n```\n\n## Proof", "action_agent_ai0": "```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\nproof -\n  (* Step 1: Define \\( N \\) as the number of students, with the conditions \\( N \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8} \\) and \\( N \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6} \\). *)\n  let ?N = \"{x::nat. x < 50 \\<and> x mod 8 = 5 \\<and> x mod 6 = 3}\"\n  \n  (* Step 2: From the first condition, we can express \\( N \\) in the form \\( N = 8k + 5 \\) for some integer \\( k \\). *)\n  have \"N = 8 * k + 5\" for k :: nat\n    by auto\n  \n  (* Step 3: Substitute this expression into the second condition: \\( 8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6} \\). *)\n  have \"8 * k + 5 mod 6 = 3\"\n    by (metis mod_add_right_eq)\n  \n  (* This simplifies to: \\( 2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6} \\implies 2k \\equiv -2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{6} \\). *)\n  have \"2 * k mod 6 = 4\"\n    by (metis mod_add_right_eq)\n  \n  (* Dividing both sides by 2 gives: \\( k \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3} \\). *)\n  have \"k mod 3 = 2\"\n    by (metis odd_even_mod)\n\n  (* Thus, we can express \\( k \\) as \\( k = 3m + 2 \\) for some integer \\( m \\). *)\n  define m where \"m = k div 3\"\n  \n  (* Step 4: Substitute back into the expression for \\( N \\): \\( N = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 21 \\). *)\n  have \"N = 24 * m + 21\"\n    by (simp add: algebra_simps)\n\n  (* Step 5: Since \\( N < 50 \\), we solve: \\( 24m + 21 < 50 \\implies 24m < 29 \\implies m < \\frac{29}{24} \\implies m \\leq 1 \\). *)\n  have \"m < 2\"\n    by (smt (verit) less_trans)\n\n  (* Thus, \\( m \\) can be 0 or 1. *)\n  \n  (* Step 6: Calculate the possible values of \\( N \\): *)\n  have \"N = 24 * 0 + 21 = 21\" \n    by simp\n  have \"N = 24 * 1 + 21 = 45\" \n    by simp\n\n  (* The possible values of \\( N \\) are 21 and 45.
