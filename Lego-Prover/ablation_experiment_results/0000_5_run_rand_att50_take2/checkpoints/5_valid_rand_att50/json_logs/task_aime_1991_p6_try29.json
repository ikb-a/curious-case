Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$. Solving shows that $\\frac{743}{100} \\le r < \\frac{744}{100}$, so $743\\le 100r < 744$, and $\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

Then, we can express the sum as:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=19}^{91} \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = \\sum_{k=19}^{91} n + \\text{(number of terms where } \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = n + 1)\n\\]\nLet \\( m \\) be the number of terms where \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = n + 1 \\). Thus, we have:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=19}^{91} \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = 73n + m\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Since the total sum equals 546, we can set up the equation:\n\\[\n73n + m = 546\n\\]\n\nStep 5: The maximum value of \\( m \\) can be 73, which occurs when all terms are \\( n + 1 \\). Therefore, we can find \\( n \\) by solving:\n\\[\nm = 546 - 73n\n\\]\nThis implies \\( 0 \\leq m \\leq 73 \\), leading to:\n\\[\n0 \\leq 546 - 73n \\leq 73\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Solving the inequalities:\n1.

Substituting back to find \\( m \\):\n\\[\nm = 546 - 73 \\cdot 7 = 547 - 511 = 35\n\\]\n\nStep 8: This means there are 35 terms where \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\) and \\( 73 - 35 =

\\implies 8 - \\frac{57}{100} \\leq r < 8.01 - \\frac{57}{100}\n\\]\nThis gives:\n\\[\n7.43 \\leq r < 7.44\n\\]\n\nStep 10: Finally, multiplying by 100 gives:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744 \\implies

(For real $x^{}_{}$, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the [[floor function|greatest integer]] less than or equal to $x^{}_{}$.) Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the summation, which is from \\( k = 19 \\) to \\( k = 91 \\). This gives us a total of \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms in the sum.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that the floor function \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) can take on values that are either \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\) depending on the value of \\( r \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( n = \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\). Then, we can express the sum as:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=19}^{91} \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = \\sum_{k=19}^{91} n + \\text{(number of terms where } \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = n + 1)\n\\]\nLet \\( m \\) be the number of terms where \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = n + 1 \\). Thus, we have:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=19}^{91} \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = 73n + m\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Since the total sum equals 546, we can set up the equation:\n\\[\n73n + m = 546\n\\]\n\nStep 5: The maximum value of \\( m \\) can be 73, which occurs when all terms are \\( n + 1 \\). Therefore, we can find \\( n \\) by solving:\n\\[\nm = 546 - 73n\n\\]\nThis implies \\( 0 \\leq m \\leq 73 \\), leading to:\n\\[\n0 \\leq 546 - 73n \\leq 73\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Solving the inequalities:\n1. From \\( 546 - 73n \\geq 0 \\):\n   \\[\n   n \\leq \\frac{546}{73} \\approx 7.48 \\implies n \\leq 7\n   \\]\n2. From \\( 546 - 73n \\leq 73 \\):\n   \\[\n   546 - 73n \\leq 73 \\implies 73n \\geq 473 \\implies n \\geq \\frac{473}{73} \\approx 6.48 \\implies n \\geq 7\n   \\]\n\nStep 7: Thus, \\( n = 7 \\). Substituting back to find \\( m \\):\n\\[\nm = 546 - 73 \\cdot 7 = 547 - 511 = 35\n\\]\n\nStep 8: This means there are 35 terms where \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\) and \\( 73 - 35 = 38 \\) terms where \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = 7 \\).\n\nStep 9: The first term where \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\) implies:\n\\[\n8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01 \\implies 8 - \\frac{57}{100} \\leq r < 8.01 - \\frac{57}{100}\n\\]\nThis gives:\n\\[\n7.43 \\leq r < 7.44\n\\]\n\nStep 10: Finally, multiplying by 100 gives:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744 \\implies \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

(For real $x^{}_{}$, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the [[floor function|greatest integer]] less than or equal to $x^{}_{}$.) Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the summation, which is from \\( k = 19 \\) to \\( k = 91 \\). This gives us a total of \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms in the sum.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that the floor function \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) can take on values that are either \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\) depending on the value of \\( r \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( n = \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\). Then, we can express the sum as:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=19}^{91} \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = \\sum_{k=19}^{91} n + \\text{(number of terms where } \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = n + 1)\n\\]\nLet \\( m \\) be the number of terms where \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = n + 1 \\). Thus, we have:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=19}^{91} \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = 73n + m\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Since the total sum equals 546, we can set up the equation:\n\\[\n73n + m = 546\n\\]\n\nStep 5: The maximum value of \\( m \\) can be 73, which occurs when all terms are \\( n + 1 \\). Therefore, we can find \\( n \\) by solving:\n\\[\nm = 546 - 73n\n\\]\nThis implies \\( 0 \\leq m \\leq 73 \\), leading to:\n\\[\n0 \\leq 546 - 73n \\leq 73\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Solving the inequalities:\n1. From \\( 546 - 73n \\geq 0 \\):\n   \\[\n   n \\leq \\frac{546}{73} \\approx 7.48 \\implies n \\leq 7\n   \\]\n2. From \\( 546 - 73n \\leq 73 \\):\n   \\[\n   546 - 73n \\leq 73 \\implies 73n \\geq 473 \\implies n \\geq \\frac{473}{73} \\approx 6.48 \\implies n \\geq 7\n   \\]\n\nStep 7: Thus, \\( n = 7 \\). Substituting back to find \\( m \\):\n\\[\nm = 546 - 73 \\cdot 7 = 547 - 511 = 35\n\\]\n\nStep 8: This means there are 35 terms where \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\) and \\( 73 - 35 = 38 \\) terms where \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = 7 \\).\n\nStep 9: The first term where \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\) implies:\n\\[\n8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01 \\implies 8 - \\frac{57}{100} \\leq r < 8.01 - \\frac{57}{100}\n\\]\nThis gives:\n\\[\n7.43 \\leq r < 7.44\n\\]\n\nStep 10: Finally, multiplying by 100 gives:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744 \\implies \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
