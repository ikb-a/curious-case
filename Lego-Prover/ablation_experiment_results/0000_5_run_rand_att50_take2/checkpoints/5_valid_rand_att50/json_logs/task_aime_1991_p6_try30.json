Also notice that $2x*x + 1 - 2x * \\sqrt{2} = 2x * (x + \\frac{1}{2x} - \\sqrt{2})$. Therefore $x + \\frac{1}{2x} - \\sqrt{2} \\geq 0$, given $2x > 0$.

Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$. Solving shows that $\\frac{743}{100} \\le r < \\frac{744}{100}$, so $743\\le 100r < 744$, and $\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the summation. The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us a total of \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that since the floor function can only change by at most 1 for consecutive values of \\( k \\), the values of \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) can only be either \\( n \\) or \\( n + 1 \\) for some integer \\( n \\).\n\nStep 3: Calculate the average of the sum. Since the total sum is 546 and there are 73 terms, the average value of the terms is \\( \\frac{546}{73} = 7.48 \\). This indicates that most of the terms are likely to be 7 or 8.\n\nStep 4: Determine how many of the terms can be 8. Let \\( x \\) be the number of terms equal to 8. Then the remaining \\( 73 - x \\) terms must be 7. The equation can be set up as:\n\\[\n7(73 - x) + 8x = 546\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\n511 + x = 546 \\implies x = 35.\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Conclude that there are 35 terms equal to 8 and 38 terms equal to 7. The first term that equals 8 occurs when \\( k = 39 \\), which corresponds to \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\). This gives us the inequality:\n\\[\n8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 9.\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Rearranging the inequality gives:\n\\[\n8 - \\frac{57}{100} \\leq r < 9 - \\frac{57}{100} \\implies \\frac{743}{100} \\leq r < \\frac{744}{100}.\n\\]\n\nStep 7: Multiply the entire inequality by 100 to find:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744.\n\\]\n\nStep 8: Conclude that \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
