Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$.

This gives us a total of \\(73\\) terms.\n\nStep 2: Since the floor function can only change by at most \\(1\\) as \\(k\\) increases, the values of the terms can either be \\( \\lfloor r + 0.19 \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r + 0.91 \\rfloor \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\(a = \\lfloor r + 0.19 \\rfloor\\) and \\(b = \\lfloor r + 0.91 \\rfloor\\). The total number of terms that equal \\(b\\) must be \\(35\\) (since \\(b\\) contributes more to the sum due to the remainder when dividing \\(546\\) by \\(73\\)), and the remaining \\(38\\) terms must equal \\(a\\).\n\nStep 4: Set up the equation based on the contributions from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\):\n\\[\n38a + 35b = 546.\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Since \\(b = a + 1\\) (because \\(b\\) is the next integer after \\(a\\)), substitute \\(b\\) into the equation:\n\\[\n38a + 35(a + 1) = 546.\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n73a + 35 = 546.\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Solve for \\(a\\):\n\\[\n73a = 511 \\implies a = \\frac{511}{73} \\approx 6.99.\n\\]\nThus, \\(a = 6\\) (since \\(a\\) must be an integer).\n\nStep 7: Now, substituting back to find \\(b\\):\n\\[\nb = a + 1 = 7.\n\\]\n\nStep 8: From the definitions of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), we have:\n\\[\n6 \\leq r + 0.19 < 7 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 7 \\leq r + 0.91 < 8.\n\\]\n\nStep 9: Rearranging these inequalities gives:\n\\[\n5.81 < r < 6.81.\n\\]\n\nStep 10: To find \\(\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor\\), we multiply the inequalities by \\(100\\):\n\\[\n581 < 100r < 681.\n\\]\n\nStep 11: Since \\(r\\) must also satisfy the upper bound from \\(b\\):\n\\[\nr + 0.91 < 8 \\implies r < 7.09 \\implies 100r < 709.\n\\]\n\nStep 12: Thus, we conclude:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744 \\implies \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743.\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
