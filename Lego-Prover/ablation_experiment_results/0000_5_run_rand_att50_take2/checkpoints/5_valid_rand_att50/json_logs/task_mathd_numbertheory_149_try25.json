What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nWe are given that $N\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $N\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$.  We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer.
