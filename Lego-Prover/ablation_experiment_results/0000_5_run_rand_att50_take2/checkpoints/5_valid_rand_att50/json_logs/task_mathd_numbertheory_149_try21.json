If their teacher puts them in groups of 8, the last group has 5 students. If their teacher instead puts them in groups of 6, the last group has 3 students. What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nWe are given that $N\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $N\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$.  We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer.

What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: We know that \\( N \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8} \\). This means \\( N \\) can be expressed as \\( N = 8k + 5 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nStep 2: We also know that \\( N \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6} \\). This means \\( N \\) can be expressed as \\( N = 6m + 3 \\) for some integer \\( m \\).\n\nStep 3: Set the two expressions for \\( N \\) equal to each other:\n\\[\n8k + 5 = 6m + 3\n\\]\nRearranging gives:\n\\[\n8k - 6m = -2\n\\]\nor equivalently,\n\\[\n4k - 3m = -1\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Solve for \\( m \\) in terms of \\( k \\):\n\\[\n3m = 4k + 1 \\implies m = \\frac{4k + 1}{3}\n\\]\nFor \\( m \\) to be an integer, \\( 4k + 1 \\) must be divisible by 3.\n\nStep 5: Check the values of \\( k \\) modulo 3:\n- If \\( k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\), then \\( 4k + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} \\) (not divisible).\n- If \\( k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} \\), then \\( 4k + 1 \\equiv 5 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3} \\) (not divisible).\n- If \\( k \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3} \\), then \\( 4k + 1 \\equiv 9 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\) (divisible).\n\nThus, \\( k \\) must be of the form \\( k = 3j + 2 \\) for some integer \\( j \\).\n\nStep 6: Substitute \\( k \\) back into the expression for \\( N \\):\n\\[\nN = 8(3j + 2) + 5 = 24j + 16 + 5 = 24j + 21\n\\]\n\nStep 7: Since \\( N < 50 \\), we solve:\n\\[\n24j + 21 < 50 \\implies 24j < 29 \\implies j < \\frac{29}{24} \\implies j = 0\n\\]\nThus, \\( N = 21 \\) when \\( j = 0 \\).\n\nStep 8: Check for \\( j = 1 \\):\n\\[\nN = 24(1) + 21 = 45\n\\]\nThis is also valid since \\( 45 < 50 \\).\n\nStep 9: The possible values of \\( N \\) are \\( 21 \\) and \\( 45 \\). Their sum is:\n\\[\n21 + 45 = 66\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n```\n\n## Proof", "action_agent_ai0": "```isabelle\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_149\n  imports Complex_Main\nbegin\n\n(* lemma 1.
