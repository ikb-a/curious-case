Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$.

The terms range from \\( k = 19 \\) to \\( k = 91 \\), which gives us \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms.\n\nStep 3: Since the floor function can only change by at most 1 as \\( k \\) increases, the values of \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) for \\( k = 19, 20, \\ldots, 91 \\) can only be either \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\).\n\nStep 4: Let \\( a \\) be the number of terms that equal \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) and \\( b \\) be the number of terms that equal \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\). We have the equations:\n- \\( a + b = 73 \\)\n- \\( a \\cdot \\lfloor r \\rfloor + b \\cdot (\\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1) = 546 \\)\n\nStep 5: Substitute \\( b = 73 - a \\) into the second equation:\n\\[\na \\cdot \\lfloor r \\rfloor + (73 - a) \\cdot (\\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1) = 546\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n73 \\cdot \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 73 - a = 546\n\\]\nThus, we can rearrange to find:\n\\[\na = 73 \\cdot \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 73 - 546\n\\]\n\\[\na = 73 \\cdot \\lfloor r \\rfloor - 473\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Since \\( a \\) must be non-negative, we have:\n\\[\n73 \\cdot \\lfloor r \\rfloor - 473 \\geq 0 \\implies \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\geq \\frac{473}{73} \\approx 6.5\n\\]\nThus, \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\geq 7 \\).\n\nStep 7: Now, substituting \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor = 7 \\) into the equation for \\( a \\):\n\\[\na = 73 \\cdot 7 - 473 = 511 - 473 = 38\n\\]\nThis means \\( b = 73 - 38 = 35 \\).\n\nStep 8: Since \\( b = 35 \\), we have 35 terms equal to 8 and 38 terms equal to 7. The first term that equals 8 occurs when \\( k = 57 \\):\n\\[\n\\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\implies 8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 9\n\\]\nThis gives:\n\\[\n8 - \\frac{57}{100} \\leq r < 9 - \\frac{57}{100} \\implies \\frac{743}{100} \\leq r < \\frac{744}{100}\n\\]\n\nStep 9: Therefore, multiplying by 100 gives:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744\n\\]\nThus, we conclude that:\n\\[\n\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743\n\\]\n\n## Request skills\n### Thoughts 1\nUnderstanding of the floor function and properties of sums will be crucial, as the proof relies heavily on these concepts.\n\n### Code 1\n```isabelle\nlemma floor_sum:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in> {m::nat..<n}.
