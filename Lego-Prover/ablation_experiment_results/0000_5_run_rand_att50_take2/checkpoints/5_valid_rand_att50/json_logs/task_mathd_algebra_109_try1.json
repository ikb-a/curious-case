Show that it is 18.\n\n## Informal proof\nWe simplify $10a + b = 2(a+b)$ to get $8a = b$. Since $a$ is at least 1, $b$ is at least 8. We know $b$ is 8 since $8a = b$ and $a$ is a natural number.

It suffices to show $\\sqrt{2} \\leq x + \\frac{1}{2x}$. Let $y = \\sqrt{2}$. $y*y = 2$. Then $2x*x + 1 - 2x * \\sqrt{2} = y*y * x*x + 1 - 2xy = (xy - 1)^2 \\geq 0$. Also notice that $2x*x + 1 - 2x * \\sqrt{2} = 2x * (x + \\frac{1}{2x} - \\sqrt{2})$. Therefore $x + \\frac{1}{2x} - \\sqrt{2} \\geq 0$, given $2x > 0$.
