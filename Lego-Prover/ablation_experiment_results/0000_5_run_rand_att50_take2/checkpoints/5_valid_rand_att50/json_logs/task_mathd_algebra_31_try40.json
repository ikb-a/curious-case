Provide a better structured step by step proof that closer to isabelle. and request relevant lemmas, theorems that might help in proving this problem.\nYou will format your answer as follows:\n- A section with the header `## Structured informal proof` containing the  step-by-step proof.\n- A subsequent section with the header `## Request skills` containing any requested relevant lemmas or theorems\n- Each requested skill is represented by an isabelle code block containing its formal definition", "human0": "## Problems\nDetermine the value of $ab$ if $\\log_8a+\\log_4b^2=5$ and $\\log_8b+\\log_4a^2=7$. Show that it is 512.\n\n## Informal proof\nWe first calculate that $\\log_2=1$, $\\log_4=2$, and $\\log_8=3$. Then let $c=\\log_a$ and $d=\\log_b$. We can write the equations as $\\frac{c}{3} + 2*\\frac{d}{2}=5$ and $\\frac{d}{3} + 2*\\frac{c}{2}=7$. Solving the equations and we get $c=6$ and $d=3$. Hence $a=2^6=64$ and $b=2^3=8$. Multiply them together and $ab=512$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem\n  fixes a b ::real\n  assumes \n    \"a > 0\"\n    \"b > 0\"\n    \"(log 2 a) / (log 2 8) + (log 2 (b^2)) / (log 2 4) = 5\"\n    \"(log 2 b) / (log 2 8) + (log 2 (a^2)) / (log 2 4) = 7\"\n  shows \"a * b = 512\"\n```\n\n## Structured informal proof\nStep 1: Calculate the base 2 logarithms of the original bases in the equations, i.e., $\\log_2 8 = 3$, $\\log_2 4 = 2$.\nStep 2: Define $c = \\log_2 a$ and $d = \\log_2 b$ to simplify the equations.\nStep 3: Rewrite the original equations in terms of c and d using the calculated base 2 logarithms. The equations become $\\frac{c}{3} + \\frac{2d}{2} = 5$ and $\\frac{d}{3} + \\frac{2c}{2} = 7$.\nStep 4: Solve the linear equations to find that $c = 6$ and $d = 3$.\nStep 5: Use the values of c and d to find $a = 2^6 = 64$ and $b = 2^3 = 8$.\nStep 6: Finally, show that $a * b = 64 * 8 = 512$ to conclude the proof.\n\n## Request skills\n### Thoughts 1\nIt would be particularly helpful to have experience solving systems of linear equations since it required to solve the linear equations in step 4.\n\n### Code 1\n```isabelle\nlemma find_a_b_value:\n  fixes c d :: real\n  assumes \n    \"c/3 + d/1 = 5\"\n    \"d/3 + c/1 = 7\"\n  shows \"c = 6 \\<and> d = 3\"\n```\n\n### Thoughts 2\nIt would be helpful for step 1 if there exists lemma that calculate the base 2 logarithms of the original bases in the equations. \n\n### Code 2\n```isabelle\nlemma log_base_to_power_equals_exponent:\n  fixes a :: real\n  assumes \"a > 0\" \"a \\<noteq> 1\" \"n > 0\"\n  shows \"log a (a^n) = n\"\n```\n\n### Thoughts 3\nIn step 5 they uses the log definition to calculate the value of a and b, which require to calculate the antilogarithm_identity which calculate the value of $b = a^c$ given $log_a b = c$\n\n### Code 3\n```isabelle\nlemma antilogarithm_identity:\n  assumes \"a > 0\" and \"a \\<noteq> 1\" and \"b > 0\" and \"log a b = c\"\n  shows \"b = a ^ c\"\n```\n\n\n####################\n\n## Problems\nFind the greatest common factor of 180 and 168.

Since $531 = 106 \\cdot 5 + 1,\\ 753 = 150 \\cdot 5 + 3,\\ 975 = 194 \\cdot 5 + 5$, it follows that  $$x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975} = (-1)^{106} x_1 + (-1)^{150} x_3 + (-1)^{194} x_5 = 211 + 420 + 267 = 898.$$\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem\n  fixes x :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> int\"\n  assumes h0 : \"x 1 = 211\"\n    and h1 : \"x 2 = 375\"\n    and h2 : \"x 3 = 420\"\n    and h3 : \"x 4 = 523\"\n    and h4 : \"\\<And>(n::nat).
