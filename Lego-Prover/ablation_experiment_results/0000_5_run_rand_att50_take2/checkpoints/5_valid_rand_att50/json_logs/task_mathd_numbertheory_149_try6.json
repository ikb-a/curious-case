Since $531 = 106 \\cdot 5 + 1,\\ 753 = 150 \\cdot 5 + 3,\\ 975 = 194 \\cdot 5 + 5$, it follows that  $$x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975} = (-1)^{106} x_1 + (-1)^{150} x_3 + (-1)^{194} x_5 = 211 + 420 + 267 = 898.$$\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem\n  fixes x :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> int\"\n  assumes h0 : \"x 1 = 211\"\n    and h1 : \"x 2 = 375\"\n    and h2 : \"x 3 = 420\"\n    and h3 : \"x 4 = 523\"\n    and h4 : \"\\<And>(n::nat).
