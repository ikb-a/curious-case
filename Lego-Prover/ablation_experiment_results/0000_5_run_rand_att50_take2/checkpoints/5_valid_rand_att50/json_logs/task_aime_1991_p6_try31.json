Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$.

Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$ Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$.

Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the summation. The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us 73 terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that since the floor function can only change by at most 1 for consecutive values of \\( k \\), the values of \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) can either be \\( n \\) or \\( n + 1 \\) for some integer \\( n \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( x \\) be the number of terms equal to \\( n + 1 \\) and \\( y \\) be the number of terms equal to \\( n \\). We know that \\( x + y = 73 \\) and the total sum is given by \\( (n + 1)x + ny = 546 \\).\n\nStep 4: Substitute \\( y = 73 - x \\) into the sum equation:\n\\[\n(n + 1)x + n(73 - x) = 546\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\nnx + 73n + x = 546 \\implies (n + 1)x + 73n = 546\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Rearranging gives:\n\\[\n(n + 1)x = 546 - 73n\n\\]\nThis indicates that \\( 546 - 73n \\) must be non-negative and divisible by \\( n + 1 \\).\n\nStep 6: Calculate the average value of the terms:\n\\[\n\\frac{546}{73} = 7.48\n\\]\nThis suggests that most terms are either 7 or 8. \n\nStep 7: Let \\( x \\) be the number of terms equal to 8. Then, \\( 8x + 7(73 - x) = 546 \\) leads to:\n\\[\n8x + 511 - 7x = 546 \\implies x = 35\n\\]\nThus, there are 35 terms equal to 8 and \\( 73 - 35 = 38 \\) terms equal to 7.\n\nStep 8: The first term where the value is 8 occurs at \\( k = 39 \\):\n\\[\n\\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\implies 8 \\leq r + 0.57 < 8.01\n\\]\nThis gives:\n\\[\n7.43 < r < 7.44\n\\]\n\nStep 9: Multiply through by 100 to find \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor \\):\n\\[\n743 < 100r < 744\n\\]\nThus, \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

The base case is trivial. Inductive case: when n is 0 it is also trivial. When $n>0$, let $m=2^n$, and we have $3^m - 1 \\equiv 4*m \\pmod{8*m}$. Then there is $k$ where $3^m - 1 = (8*m)*k + 4*m$. Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$ Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$. Therefore the inductive case holds.

(For real $x^{}_{}$, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the [[floor function|greatest integer]] less than or equal to $x^{}_{}$.) Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the summation. The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us 73 terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that since the floor function can only change by at most 1 for consecutive values of \\( k \\), the values of \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) can either be \\( n \\) or \\( n + 1 \\) for some integer \\( n \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( x \\) be the number of terms equal to \\( n + 1 \\) and \\( y \\) be the number of terms equal to \\( n \\). We know that \\( x + y = 73 \\) and the total sum is given by \\( (n + 1)x + ny = 546 \\).\n\nStep 4: Substitute \\( y = 73 - x \\) into the sum equation:\n\\[\n(n + 1)x + n(73 - x) = 546\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\nnx + 73n + x = 546 \\implies (n + 1)x + 73n = 546\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Rearranging gives:\n\\[\n(n + 1)x = 546 - 73n\n\\]\nThis indicates that \\( 546 - 73n \\) must be non-negative and divisible by \\( n + 1 \\).\n\nStep 6: Calculate the average value of the terms:\n\\[\n\\frac{546}{73} = 7.48\n\\]\nThis suggests that most terms are either 7 or 8. \n\nStep 7: Let \\( x \\) be the number of terms equal to 8. Then, \\( 8x + 7(73 - x) = 546 \\) leads to:\n\\[\n8x + 511 - 7x = 546 \\implies x = 35\n\\]\nThus, there are 35 terms equal to 8 and \\( 73 - 35 = 38 \\) terms equal to 7.\n\nStep 8: The first term where the value is 8 occurs at \\( k = 39 \\):\n\\[\n\\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\implies 8 \\leq r + 0.57 < 8.01\n\\]\nThis gives:\n\\[\n7.43 < r < 7.44\n\\]\n\nStep 9: Multiply through by 100 to find \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor \\):\n\\[\n743 < 100r < 744\n\\]\nThus, \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
