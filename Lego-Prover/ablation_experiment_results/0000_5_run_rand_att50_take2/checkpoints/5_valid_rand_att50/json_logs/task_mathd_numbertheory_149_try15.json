We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer.

What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: We start with the congruences given in the problem: \\( N \\equiv 5 \\mod 8 \\) and \\( N \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\).\n\nStep 2: From the first congruence, we can express \\( N \\) in the form:\n\\[\nN = 8k + 5\n\\]\nfor some integer \\( k \\).\n\nStep 3: Substitute this expression for \\( N \\) into the second congruence:\n\\[\n8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6.\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Simplifying the left-hand side modulo 6, we have:\n\\[\n2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6.\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Rearranging gives:\n\\[\n2k \\equiv 3 - 5 \\equiv -2 \\equiv 4 \\mod 6.\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Dividing both sides by 2 (noting that 2 has an inverse modulo 6), we find:\n\\[\nk \\equiv 2 \\mod 3.\n\\]\n\nStep 7: This means we can express \\( k \\) as:\n\\[\nk = 3m + 2\n\\]\nfor some integer \\( m \\).\n\nStep 8: Substitute back into the expression for \\( N \\):\n\\[\nN = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21.\n\\]\n\nStep 9: Now we need to find values of \\( N \\) that are less than 50:\n\\[\n24m + 21 < 50 \\implies 24m < 29 \\implies m < \\frac{29}{24} \\implies m \\leq 1.\n\\]\n\nStep 10: The possible values for \\( m \\) are \\( 0 \\) and \\( 1 \\):\n- For \\( m = 0 \\): \\( N = 21 \\).\n- For \\( m = 1 \\): \\( N = 45 \\).\n\nStep 11: The valid values of \\( N \\) are \\( 21 \\) and \\( 45 \\).\n\nStep 12: Finally, we compute the sum of all possible values of \\( N \\):\n\\[\n21 + 45 = 66.\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n```\n\n## Proof", "action_agent_ai0": "```isabelle\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_149\n  imports Complex_Main\nbegin\n\n(* formal statement copied from the input *)\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\nproof -\n  (* Step 1: We need to find all integers N < 50 satisfying the conditions N \u2261 5 (mod 8) and N \u2261 3 (mod 6). *)\n  \n  (* Step 2: Start with the congruence N \u2261 5 mod 8.
