If their teacher puts them in groups of 8, the last group has 5 students. If their teacher instead puts them in groups of 6, the last group has 3 students. What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nWe are given that $N\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $N\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$.  We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer. Thus the 2 solutions less than $50$ are 21 and $21+24(1) = 45$, and their sum is $21+45=66$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50

Informal proof\nWe prove by induction on n. The base case is trivial. Inductive case: when n is 0 it is also trivial. When $n>0$, let $m=2^n$, and we have $3^m - 1 \\equiv 4*m \\pmod{8*m}$. Then there is $k$ where $3^m - 1 = (8*m)*k + 4*m$. Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$ Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$.

Informal proof\nWe prove by induction on n. The base case is trivial. Inductive case: when n is 0 it is also trivial. When $n>0$, let $m=2^n$, and we have $3^m - 1 \\equiv 4*m \\pmod{8*m}$. Then there is $k$ where $3^m - 1 = (8*m)*k + 4*m$. Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$ Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$.

If their teacher puts them in groups of 8, the last group has 5 students. If their teacher instead puts them in groups of 6, the last group has 3 students. What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: We start with the congruences given in the problem: \\( N \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8} \\) and \\( N \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6} \\).\n\nStep 2: From the first congruence, we can express \\( N \\) in the form:\n\\[\nN = 8k + 5\n\\]\nfor some integer \\( k \\).\n\nStep 3: Substitute this expression into the second congruence:\n\\[\n8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6}\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6}\n\\]\nwhich further simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k \\equiv -2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{6}\n\\]\nDividing both sides by 2 gives:\n\\[\nk \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}\n\\]\n\nStep 4: We can express \\( k \\) in terms of another integer \\( m \\):\n\\[\nk = 3m + 2\n\\]\nfor some integer \\( m \\).\n\nStep 5: Substitute back into the expression for \\( N \\):\n\\[\nN = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21\n\\]\n\nStep 6: We need \\( N < 50 \\):\n\\[\n24m + 21 < 50 \\implies 24m < 29 \\implies m < \\frac{29}{24} \\implies m \\leq 1\n\\]\nThus, \\( m \\) can take values \\( 0 \\) or \\( 1 \\).\n\nStep 7: Calculate the possible values of \\( N \\):\n- For \\( m = 0 \\):\n\\[\nN = 24(0) + 21 = 21\n\\]\n- For \\( m = 1 \\):\n\\[\nN = 24(1) + 21 = 45\n\\]\n\nStep 8: The possible values of \\( N \\) are \\( 21 \\) and \\( 45 \\).\n\nStep 9: Finally, we compute the sum of all possible values of \\( N \\):\n\\[\n21 + 45 = 66\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n```\n\n## Proof", "action_agent_ai0": "```isabelle\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_149\nimports Complex_Main\nbegin\n\n(* formal statement copy from the input *)\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\nproof -\n  (* Step 1: We start with the congruences given in the problem: N \u2261 5 (mod 8) and N \u2261 3 (mod 6). *)\n  let ?S = \"{x::nat. x < 50 \\<and> x mod 8 = 5 \\<and> x mod 6 = 3}\"\n  \n  (* Step 2: We will examine values of N that satisfy both congruences. *)\n  (* The congruence N \u2261 5 (mod 8) gives us the form N = 8k + 5 for some integer k. *)\n  (* We will substitute this into the second congruence. *)\n  \n  (* Step 3: Substitute into the second congruence N \u2261 3 (mod 6): *)\n  have \"N mod 6 = (8k + 5) mod 6\" \n    for k::nat\n    by (simp add: mod_add)\n\n  (* Step 4: Simplifying the expression: *)\n  have \"(8k + 5) mod 6 = (2k + 5) mod 6\" \n    by (simp add: mod_mult)\n\n  (* Step 5: We need this to equal 3: *)\n  have \"2k + 5 \u2261 3 (mod 6)\" \n    by simp\n  \n  (* Step 6: This simplifies to: *)\n  have \"2k \u2261 -2 \u2261 4 (mod 6)\" \n    by (simp add: mod_diff)\n\n  (* Step 7: Dividing both sides by 2 gives us: *)\n  have \"k \u2261 2 (mod 3)\" \n    by (metis two_times)\n\n  (* Step 8: We can express k in terms of another integer m: *)\n  have \"k = 3m + 2\" \n    for m::nat\n    by auto\n\n  (* Step 9: Substitute back into the expression for N: *)\n  have \"N = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21\" \n    by (simp add: algebra_simps)\n\n  (* Step 10: We need N < 50: *)\n  have \"24m + 21 < 50 \u27f9 24m < 29 \u27f9 m < 29/24 \u27f9 m \u2264 1\" \n    by simp\n\n  (* Step 11: Thus, m can take values 0 or 1: *)\n  let ?values = \"{N.
