Substituting into one of the given equations, we have $x+xy=5$ $x(1+y)=5$ $\\frac{1}{x}=\\frac{1+y}{5}.$ we can substitute back into $y+\\frac{1}{x}=29$ to obtain $y+\\frac{1+y}{5}=29$ $5y+1+y=145$ $y=24.$ We can then substitute once again to get $x=\\frac15$ $z=\\frac{5}{24}.$ Thus, $z+\\frac1y=\\frac{5}{24}+\\frac{1}{24}=\\frac{1}{4}$, so $m+n=005$.\n\n## Formal statement\ntheorem\n  fixes x y z :: real\n    and p :: rat\n  assumes \"0 < x \\<and> 0 < y \\<and> 0 < z\"\n    and \"x * y * z = 1\"\n    and \"x + 1 / z = 5\"\n    and \"y + 1 / x = 29\"\n    and \"z + 1 / y = p\"\n    and \"0 < p\" \n  shows \"let (m,n) = quotient_of p in m + n = 5\"\n\n## Structured informal proof\nStep 1: Rewrite the equation $xyz = 1$ as $\\frac{1}{z} = xy$.\nStep 2: Substitute the value of $\\frac{1}{z}$ into the equation $x + \\frac{1}{z} = 5$, resulting in $x + xy = 5$ then $x(1 + y) = 5$.\nStep 3: Solve for $\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{1 + y}{5}$.\nStep 4: Substitute the value of $\\frac{1}{x}$ into the equation $y + \\frac{1}{x} = 29$, leading to $y + \\frac{1+y}{5} = 29$.\nStep 5: Solve for $y$, getting $y = 24$.\nStep 6: Substitute the value of $y$ back into the equations to find $x = \\frac{1}{5}$ and $z = \\frac{5}{24}$.\nStep 7: Find $z + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{5}{24} + \\frac{1}{24} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nStep 8: The rational $p = \\frac{1}{4}$ can be expressed as $p = \\frac{m}{n}$ where $m = 1$ and $n = 4$.

Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nThere are $91 - 19 + 1 = 73$ numbers in the [[sequence]]. Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$. Solving shows that $\\frac{743}{100} \\le r < \\frac{744}{100}$, so $743\\le 100r < 744$, and $\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us 73 terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that the floor function can yield either \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) as \\( n \\) or \\( n + 1 \\) depending on the value of \\( r \\). Since there are 73 terms, the sum can be expressed as a combination of \\( 7 \\)s and \\( 8 \\)s.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the average value of the terms. Since the total sum is 546, we find the average:\n\\[\n\\frac{546}{73} = 7.48\n\\]\nThis indicates that the terms must be predominantly \\( 7 \\)s and some \\( 8 \\)s.\n\nStep 4: Let \\( x \\) be the number of \\( 8 \\)s. Then, the number of \\( 7 \\)s is \\( 73 - x \\). The equation for the sum becomes:\n\\[\n7(73 - x) + 8x = 546\n\\]\nSimplifying this gives:\n\\[\n511 - 7x + 8x = 546 \\implies x = 35\n\\]\nThus, there are 35 terms equal to \\( 8 \\) and \\( 38 \\) terms equal to \\( 7 \\).\n\nStep 5: Determine the bounds for \\( r \\). The first term that equals \\( 8 \\) occurs when \\( k = 57 \\):\n\\[\n\\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\implies 8 \\leq r + 0.57 < 9 \\implies 7.43 \\leq r < 8.43\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Convert the bounds for \\( r \\) into bounds for \\( 100r \\):\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 843\n\\]\n\nStep 7: Since \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor \\) must be an integer, we conclude:\n\\[\n\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743\n\\]\n\n## Request skills\n### Thoughts 1\nUnderstanding the properties of the floor function and how it interacts with real numbers is crucial for this proof.\n\n### Code 1\n```isabelle\nlemma floor_sum_properties:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the sum. The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us 73 terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that the floor function can yield either \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) as \\( n \\) or \\( n + 1 \\) depending on the value of \\( r \\). Since there are 73 terms, the sum can be expressed as a combination of \\( 7 \\)s and \\( 8 \\)s.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the average value of the terms. Since the total sum is 546, we find the average:\n\\[\n\\frac{546}{73} = 7.48\n\\]\nThis indicates that the terms must be predominantly \\( 7 \\)s and some \\( 8 \\)s.\n\nStep 4: Let \\( x \\) be the number of \\( 8 \\)s. Then, the number of \\( 7 \\)s is \\( 73 - x \\). The equation for the sum becomes:\n\\[\n7(73 - x) + 8x = 546\n\\]\nSimplifying this gives:\n\\[\n511 - 7x + 8x = 546 \\implies x = 35\n\\]\nThus, there are 35 terms equal to \\( 8 \\) and \\( 38 \\) terms equal to \\( 7 \\).\n\nStep 5: Determine the bounds for \\( r \\). The first term that equals \\( 8 \\) occurs when \\( k = 57 \\):\n\\[\n\\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\implies 8 \\leq r + 0.57 < 9 \\implies 7.43 \\leq r < 8.43\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Convert the bounds for \\( r \\) into bounds for \\( 100r \\):\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 843\n\\]\n\nStep 7: Since \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor \\) must be an integer, we conclude:\n\\[\n\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the sum. The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us 73 terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that the floor function can yield either \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) as \\( n \\) or \\( n + 1 \\) depending on the value of \\( r \\). Since there are 73 terms, the sum can be expressed as a combination of \\( 7 \\)s and \\( 8 \\)s.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the average value of the terms. Since the total sum is 546, we find the average:\n\\[\n\\frac{546}{73} = 7.48\n\\]\nThis indicates that the terms must be predominantly \\( 7 \\)s and some \\( 8 \\)s.\n\nStep 4: Let \\( x \\) be the number of \\( 8 \\)s. Then, the number of \\( 7 \\)s is \\( 73 - x \\). The equation for the sum becomes:\n\\[\n7(73 - x) + 8x = 546\n\\]\nSimplifying this gives:\n\\[\n511 - 7x + 8x = 546 \\implies x = 35\n\\]\nThus, there are 35 terms equal to \\( 8 \\) and \\( 38 \\) terms equal to \\( 7 \\).\n\nStep 5: Determine the bounds for \\( r \\). The first term that equals \\( 8 \\) occurs when \\( k = 57 \\):\n\\[\n\\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\implies 8 \\leq r + 0.57 < 9 \\implies 7.43 \\leq r < 8.43\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Convert the bounds for \\( r \\) into bounds for \\( 100r \\):\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 843\n\\]\n\nStep 7: Since \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor \\) must be an integer, we conclude:\n\\[\n\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
