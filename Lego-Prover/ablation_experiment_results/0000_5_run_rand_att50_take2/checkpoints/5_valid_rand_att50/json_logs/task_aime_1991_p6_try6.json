Also notice that $2x*x + 1 - 2x * \\sqrt{2} = 2x * (x + \\frac{1}{2x} - \\sqrt{2})$. Therefore $x + \\frac{1}{2x} - \\sqrt{2} \\geq 0$, given $2x > 0$.

Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$.

The summation runs from \\( k = 19 \\) to \\( k = 91 \\), which gives us \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that each term \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) can take on either \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\) depending on the value of \\( r \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( n = \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\). Then, the terms can be either \\( n \\) or \\( n + 1 \\). The total contribution to the sum from these terms can be expressed as:\n\\[\nx \\cdot n + (73 - x) \\cdot (n + 1) = 546\n\\]\nwhere \\( x \\) is the number of terms equal to \\( n + 1 \\).\n\nStep 4: Simplifying the equation gives:\n\\[\nx \\cdot n + (73 - x) \\cdot (n + 1) = 546 \\implies x \\cdot n + 73n + 73 - x \\cdot n - x = 546 \\implies 73 + 73 - x = 546 \\implies 73 - x = 546 - 73n\n\\]\nThus, we have:\n\\[\nx = 73 - (546 - 73n) = 73n - 473\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Since \\( x \\) must be a non-negative integer, we have:\n\\[\n73n - 473 \\geq 0 \\implies n \\geq \\frac{473}{73} \\approx 6.5 \\implies n \\geq 7\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Now, we also know that the maximum possible value of \\( x \\) is 73, which gives:\n\\[\n73n - 473 \\leq 73 \\implies 73n \\leq 546 \\implies n \\leq \\frac{546}{73} \\approx 7.48 \\implies n \\leq 7\n\\]\n\nStep 7: Combining the inequalities, we find \\( n = 7 \\).\n\nStep 8: Substitute \\( n = 7 \\) back into the equation for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = 73 \\cdot 7 - 473 = 511 - 473 = 38\n\\]\n\nStep 9: This means there are 38 terms equal to \\( 8 \\) and \\( 35 \\) terms equal to \\( 7 \\). The first term that equals \\( 8 \\) occurs when \\( k = 57 \\):\n\\[\n\\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\implies 8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 9 \\implies 8 - \\frac{57}{100} \\leq r < 9 - \\frac{57}{100}\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\frac{743}{100} \\leq r < \\frac{744}{100}\n\\]\n\nStep 10: Therefore, multiplying by 100 gives:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744 \\implies \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
