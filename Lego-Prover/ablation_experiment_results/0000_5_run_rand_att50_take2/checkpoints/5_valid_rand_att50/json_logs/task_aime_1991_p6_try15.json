Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nThere are $91 - 19 + 1 = 73$ numbers in the [[sequence]]. Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$. Solving shows that $\\frac{743}{100} \\le r < \\frac{744}{100}$, so $743\\le 100r < 744$, and $\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}. (floor (r + k / 100))) = 546\" \n  shows \"floor (100 * r) = 743\"\n```\n", "ai0": "## Structured informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the summation, which is from \\( k = 19 \\) to \\( k = 91 \\). This gives us a total of \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms.\n\nStep 2: Since the floor function can only take integer values, the sum of these 73 terms must be close to the average value of the terms. Calculate the average: \n\\[\n\\frac{546}{73} = 7.48 \\text{ (approximately)}.\n\\]\nThis indicates that most of the terms are likely to be either 7 or 8.\n\nStep 3: Let \\( x \\) be the number of terms equal to 8. Then the number of terms equal to 7 is \\( 73 - x \\). Set up the equation:\n\\[\n8x + 7(73 - x) = 546.\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n8x + 511 - 7x = 546 \\implies x + 511 = 546 \\implies x = 35.\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Thus, there are 35 terms equal to 8 and \\( 73 - 35 = 38 \\) terms equal to 7.\n\nStep 5: The first term in the sequence where the value is 8 corresponds to \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor \\). This means:\n\\[\n8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01.\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Rearranging gives:\n\\[\n8 - \\frac{57}{100} \\leq r < 8.01 - \\frac{57}{100} \\implies 7.43 \\leq r < 7.44.\n\\]\n\nStep 7: Multiply the entire inequality by 100:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744.\n\\]\n\nStep 8: Therefore, \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Request skills\n### Thoughts 1\nA skill in manipulating sums

(For real $x^{}_{}$, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the [[floor function|greatest integer]] less than or equal to $x^{}_{}$.) Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the summation, which is from \\( k = 19 \\) to \\( k = 91 \\). This gives us a total of \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms.\n\nStep 2: Since the floor function can only take integer values, the sum of these 73 terms must be close to the average value of the terms. Calculate the average: \n\\[\n\\frac{546}{73} = 7.48 \\text{ (approximately)}.\n\\]\nThis indicates that most of the terms are likely to be either 7 or 8.\n\nStep 3: Let \\( x \\) be the number of terms equal to 8. Then the number of terms equal to 7 is \\( 73 - x \\). Set up the equation:\n\\[\n8x + 7(73 - x) = 546.\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n8x + 511 - 7x = 546 \\implies x + 511 = 546 \\implies x = 35.\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Thus, there are 35 terms equal to 8 and \\( 73 - 35 = 38 \\) terms equal to 7.\n\nStep 5: The first term in the sequence where the value is 8 corresponds to \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor \\). This means:\n\\[\n8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01.\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Rearranging gives:\n\\[\n8 - \\frac{57}{100} \\leq r < 8.01 - \\frac{57}{100} \\implies 7.43 \\leq r < 7.44.\n\\]\n\nStep 7: Multiply the entire inequality by 100:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744.\n\\]\n\nStep 8: Therefore, \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

(For real $x^{}_{}$, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the [[floor function|greatest integer]] less than or equal to $x^{}_{}$.) Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the summation, which is from \\( k = 19 \\) to \\( k = 91 \\). This gives us a total of \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms.\n\nStep 2: Since the floor function can only take integer values, the sum of these 73 terms must be close to the average value of the terms. Calculate the average: \n\\[\n\\frac{546}{73} = 7.48 \\text{ (approximately)}.\n\\]\nThis indicates that most of the terms are likely to be either 7 or 8.\n\nStep 3: Let \\( x \\) be the number of terms equal to 8. Then the number of terms equal to 7 is \\( 73 - x \\). Set up the equation:\n\\[\n8x + 7(73 - x) = 546.\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n8x + 511 - 7x = 546 \\implies x + 511 = 546 \\implies x = 35.\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Thus, there are 35 terms equal to 8 and \\( 73 - 35 = 38 \\) terms equal to 7.\n\nStep 5: The first term in the sequence where the value is 8 corresponds to \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor \\). This means:\n\\[\n8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01.\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Rearranging gives:\n\\[\n8 - \\frac{57}{100} \\leq r < 8.01 - \\frac{57}{100} \\implies 7.43 \\leq r < 7.44.\n\\]\n\nStep 7: Multiply the entire inequality by 100:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744.\n\\]\n\nStep 8: Therefore, \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
