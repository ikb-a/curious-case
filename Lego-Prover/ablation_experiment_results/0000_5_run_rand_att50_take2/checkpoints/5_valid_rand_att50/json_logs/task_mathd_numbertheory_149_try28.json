What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nWe are given that $N\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $N\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$.  We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer.

If their teacher puts them in groups of 8, the last group has 5 students. If their teacher instead puts them in groups of 6, the last group has 3 students. What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: We start with the congruences given in the problem: \\( N \\equiv 5 \\mod 8 \\) and \\( N \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\).\n\nStep 2: From the first congruence, we can express \\( N \\) in the form \\( N = 8k + 5 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nStep 3: Substitute \\( N \\) into the second congruence: \n\\[\n8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6.\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6.\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Rearranging gives:\n\\[\n2k \\equiv -2 \\mod 6 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 2k \\equiv 4 \\mod 6.\n\\]\nDividing through by 2 (noting that 2 and 6 are coprime), we have:\n\\[\nk \\equiv 2 \\mod 3.\n\\]\n\nStep 5: This means \\( k \\) can be expressed as \\( k = 3m + 2 \\) for some integer \\( m \\).\n\nStep 6: Substitute back into the expression for \\( N \\):\n\\[\nN = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21.\n\\]\n\nStep 7: Now we need to find values of \\( N \\) such that \\( N < 50 \\):\n\\[\n24m + 21 < 50 \\implies 24m < 29 \\implies m < \\frac{29}{24} \\implies m \\leq 1.\n\\]\n\nStep 8: The possible values for \\( m \\) are \\( 0 \\) and \\( 1 \\):\n- For \\( m = 0 \\): \\( N = 21 \\).\n- For \\( m = 1 \\): \\( N = 45 \\).\n\nStep 9: The valid values of \\( N \\) are \\( 21 \\) and \\( 45 \\). \n\nStep 10: Finally, we compute the sum of all possible values of \\( N \\):\n\\[\n21 + 45 = 66.\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n```\n\n## Proof", "action_agent_ai0": "```isabelle\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_149\n  imports Complex_Main\nbegin\n\n(* Step 1: Define the conditions for N based on the problem statement. *)\nlemma mod_conditions:\n  fixes N :: nat\n  assumes \"N < 50\"\n    and \"N mod 8 = 5\"\n    and \"N mod 6 = 3\"\n  shows \"N \u2208 {21, 45}\"\nproof -\n  (* Step 2: Express N in terms of k from the first congruence. *)\n  have \"N = 8k + 5\" for k :: nat\n    using assms(2) by auto\n\n  (* Step 3: Substitute N into the second congruence. *)\n  have \"8k + 5 mod 6 = 3\" \n    by (metis assms(3) mod_add_eq)\n\n  (* Step 4: Simplify the equation. *)\n  have \"2k + 5 mod 6 = 3\" \n    by (metis mod_add_eq)\n\n  (* Step 5: Rearranging gives us another congruence. *)\n  have \"2k \u2261 -2 mod 6\" \n    by (metis (no_types, lifting) add.commute)\n\n  (* Step 6: This simplifies to 2k \u2261 4 mod 6. *)\n  have \"k \u2261 2 mod 3\" \n    using assms(2) by (metis div_mod_eq)\n\n  (* Step 7: Express k in terms of m. *)\n  have \"k = 3m + 2\" for m :: nat\n    by auto\n\n  (* Step 8: Substitute back into N. *)\n  have \"N = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21\"\n    by simp\n\n  (* Step 9: Now find values of N such that N < 50. *)\n  have \"24m + 21 < 50 \u27f9 24m < 29 \u27f9 m < 29/24 \u27f9 m \u2264 1\"\n    using less_trans[of \"24*m\" \"50-21\" \"29\"] by simp\n\n  (* Step 10: The possible values for m are 0 and 1. *)\n  have \"m = 0 \u27f9 N = 21\" \n    by auto\n  have \"m = 1 \u27f9 N = 45\" \n    by auto\n\n  (* Step 11: Thus, the valid values for N are 21 and 45. *)\n  have \"N \u2208 {21, 45}\" \n    using `m \u2264 1` by auto\n\n  (* Step 12: Conclude the proof with the final result. *)\n  show ?thesis \n    by (simp add: `N \u2208 {21, 45}`)\nqed\n\n(* Step 13: Compute the sum of all possible values of N. *)\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\nproof -\n  have \"{x::nat. x < 50 \\<and> x mod 8 = 5 \\<and> x mod 6 = 3} = {21, 45}\" \n    by (metis mod_conditions)\n\n  then have \"(\\<Sum>k\\<in>{21, 45}. k) = 21 + 45\" \n    by auto\n\n  then show ?thesis \n    by simp\nqed\n\nend\n```"}}
