Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$. Solving shows that $\\frac{743}{100} \\le r < \\frac{744}{100}$, so $743\\le 100r < 744$, and $\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

The base case is trivial. Inductive case: when n is 0 it is also trivial. When $n>0$, let $m=2^n$, and we have $3^m - 1 \\equiv 4*m \\pmod{8*m}$. Then there is $k$ where $3^m - 1 = (8*m)*k + 4*m$. Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$ Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$. Therefore the inductive case holds.

(For real $x^{}_{}$, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the [[floor function|greatest integer]] less than or equal to $x^{}_{}$.) Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the sum. The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us 73 terms.\n\nStep 2: Since the floor function can only change by at most 1 for consecutive values of \\( k \\), the values of \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) can either be \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( n = \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\). The total number of terms that equal \\( n \\) and \\( n + 1 \\) must satisfy the equation:\n\\[\nx(n) + y(n + 1) = 546\n\\]\nwhere \\( x \\) is the count of terms equal to \\( n \\) and \\( y \\) is the count of terms equal to \\( n + 1 \\). We also know that \\( x + y = 73 \\).\n\nStep 4: From the two equations, we can express \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\):\n\\[\ny = 73 - x\n\\]\nSubstituting this into the first equation gives:\n\\[\nx(n) + (73 - x)(n + 1) = 546\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\nxn + 73n + 73 - xn - x = 546\n\\]\nThis leads to:\n\\[\n73n + 73 - x = 546\n\\]\nThus:\n\\[\nx = 73n + 73 - 546 = 73n - 473\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Since \\( x \\) must be non-negative, we have:\n\\[\n73n - 473 \\geq 0 \\implies n \\geq \\frac{473}{73} \\approx 6.5\n\\]\nThus, \\( n \\geq 7 \\).\n\nStep 6: Now, we can find the maximum possible value of \\( n \\) by considering the total sum:\n\\[\nx(n) + y(n + 1) = 546\n\\]\nIf \\( n = 7 \\):\n\\[\nx(7) + y(8) = 546 \\implies x + (73 - x) \\cdot 8 = 546\n\\]\nThis leads to:\n\\[\n7x + 8(73 - x) = 546 \\implies 7x + 584 - 8x = 546 \\implies -x + 584 = 546 \\implies x = 38\n\\]\nThus, \\( y = 73 - 38 = 35 \\).\n\nStep 7: The critical point is \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\), which gives:\n\\[\n8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01 \\implies 7.43 \\leq r < 7.44\n\\]\nMultiplying by 100 gives:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744\n\\]\nThus, \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

1 \\equiv 2^{n+2} \\pmod{2^{n+3}}$.\n\n## Informal proof\nWe prove by induction on n. The base case is trivial. Inductive case: when n is 0 it is also trivial. When $n>0$, let $m=2^n$, and we have $3^m - 1 \\equiv 4*m \\pmod{8*m}$. Then there is $k$ where $3^m - 1 = (8*m)*k + 4*m$. Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$ Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$. Therefore the inductive case holds.

(For real $x^{}_{}$, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the [[floor function|greatest integer]] less than or equal to $x^{}_{}$.) Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the sum. The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us 73 terms.\n\nStep 2: Since the floor function can only change by at most 1 for consecutive values of \\( k \\), the values of \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) can either be \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( n = \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\). The total number of terms that equal \\( n \\) and \\( n + 1 \\) must satisfy the equation:\n\\[\nx(n) + y(n + 1) = 546\n\\]\nwhere \\( x \\) is the count of terms equal to \\( n \\) and \\( y \\) is the count of terms equal to \\( n + 1 \\). We also know that \\( x + y = 73 \\).\n\nStep 4: From the two equations, we can express \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\):\n\\[\ny = 73 - x\n\\]\nSubstituting this into the first equation gives:\n\\[\nx(n) + (73 - x)(n + 1) = 546\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\nxn + 73n + 73 - xn - x = 546\n\\]\nThis leads to:\n\\[\n73n + 73 - x = 546\n\\]\nThus:\n\\[\nx = 73n + 73 - 546 = 73n - 473\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Since \\( x \\) must be non-negative, we have:\n\\[\n73n - 473 \\geq 0 \\implies n \\geq \\frac{473}{73} \\approx 6.5\n\\]\nThus, \\( n \\geq 7 \\).\n\nStep 6: Now, we can find the maximum possible value of \\( n \\) by considering the total sum:\n\\[\nx(n) + y(n + 1) = 546\n\\]\nIf \\( n = 7 \\):\n\\[\nx(7) + y(8) = 546 \\implies x + (73 - x) \\cdot 8 = 546\n\\]\nThis leads to:\n\\[\n7x + 8(73 - x) = 546 \\implies 7x + 584 - 8x = 546 \\implies -x + 584 = 546 \\implies x = 38\n\\]\nThus, \\( y = 73 - 38 = 35 \\).\n\nStep 7: The critical point is \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\), which gives:\n\\[\n8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01 \\implies 7.43 \\leq r < 7.44\n\\]\nMultiplying by 100 gives:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744\n\\]\nThus, \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
