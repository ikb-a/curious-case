Let $b = a mod 3$. We know that b can only be 0, 1, or 2. Also, $a^2 mod 3 = b^2 mod 3$. If $b=0$, $a^2 mod 3 = 0^2 mod 3 = 0$; If $b=1$, $a^2 mod 3 = 1^2 mod 3 = 1$; If $b=2$, $a^2 mod 3 = 2^2 mod 3 = 1$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem\n  fixes a :: int\n  shows \"a^2 mod 3 = 0 \\<or> a^2 mod 3 = 1\"\n```\n\n## Structured informal proof\nStep 1: Introduce a new variable $b$ such that $b = a \\mod 3$. This simplifies the expression since $b$ can only be 0, 1, or 2.\nStep 2: State that $a^2 \\mod 3 = b^2 \\mod 3$, which can be proved using the properties of modulo arithmetic.\nStep 3: Enumerate the cases for $b$, i.e., $b = 0$, $b = 1$, or $b = 2$.\nStep 4: For each case, calculate $b^2 \\mod 3$.

Since \\( n \\) is a positive integer, both \\( n-1 \\) and \\( n-2 \\) are non-negative integers. \n\nStep 3: Note that one of the factors \\( n-1 \\) or \\( n-2 \\) is odd and the other is even. The product of an even and an odd number is even.\n\nStep 4: The only even prime number is \\( 2 \\). Therefore, we need to find when \\( (n-2)(n-1) = 2 \\).\n\nStep 5: Set up the equation \\( (n-2)(n-1) = 2 \\) and solve for \\( n \\):\n- If \\( n-2 = 1 \\) and \\( n-1 = 2 \\), then \\( n = 3 \\).\n- If \\( n-2 = 2 \\) and \\( n-1 = 1 \\), then \\( n = 4 \\) (not valid since \\( 4-2 = 2 \\) and \\( 4-1 = 3 \\) gives \\( 6 \\)).\n- If \\( n-2 = 0 \\) and \\( n-1 = 2 \\), then \\( n = 2 \\) (not valid since \\( 2-2 = 0 \\) and \\( 2-1 = 1 \\) gives \\( 0 \\)).\n- If \\( n-2 = -1 \\) and \\( n-1 = -2 \\), then \\( n = 1 \\) (not valid since \\( 1-2 = -1 \\) and \\( 1-1 = 0 \\) gives \\( 0 \\)).\n\nStep 6: The only valid solution is \\( n = 3 \\), which gives \\( (3-2)(3-1) = 1 \\cdot 2 = 2 \\), a prime number.\n\nStep 7: Conclude that the only positive integer \\( n \\) for which \\( n^2 - 3n + 2 \\) is prime is \\( n = 3 \\). Thus, the answer is (B) one.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem amc12b_2002_p3:\n  fixes n ::nat\n  assumes \"n>0\"\n    and prime:\"prime (n^2+2-3*n)\"\n  shows \"n=3\"\n```\n\n## Proof"}}
