We can write the equations as $\\frac{c}{3} + 2*\\frac{d}{2}=5$ and $\\frac{d}{3} + 2*\\frac{c}{2}=7$. Solving the equations and we get $c=6$ and $d=3$. Hence $a=2^6=64$ and $b=2^3=8$.

We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer. Thus the 2 solutions less than $50$ are 21 and $21+24(1) = 45$, and their sum is $21+45=66$.", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_149 \n  imports Complex_Main \"HOL-Computational_Algebra.Computational_Algebra\"\n  \"HOL-Number_Theory.Number_Theory\"\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n  sorry\n\nend   "}, "verified_result": {"success": false, "reason": "Step error: Illegal application of proof command in \"prove\" mode\nAt command \"'thus \"5 < 50\" and \"3 < 50\"'\" (line 13)", "num_steps": 32, "last_step": 9, "error_step_index": 8, "step_results": [{"index": 0, "step": "theory mathd_numbertheory_149\nimports Complex_Main\nbegin", "output": "", "step_time": 0.007929801940917969}, {"index": 1, "step": "\n\n(* formal statement copy from the input *)\n", "output": "", "step_time": 0.0072057247161865234}, {"index": 2, "step": "theorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"", "output": "proof (prove)\ngoal (1 subgoal):\n 1. \\<Sum> {x. x < 50 \\<and> x mod 8 = 5 \\<and> x mod 6 = 3} = 66", "step_time": 0.01793980598449707}, {"index": 3, "step": "proof -", "output": "proof (state)\ngoal (1 subgoal):\n 1. \\<Sum> {x. x < 50 \\<and> x mod 8 = 5 \\<and> x mod 6 = 3} = 66", "step_time": 0.009667158126831055}, {"index": 4, "step": "\n  (* Step 1: Define the set of possible values of N based on the given conditions. *)\n  ", "output": "proof (state)\ngoal (1 subgoal):\n 1. \\<Sum> {x. x < 50 \\<and> x mod 8 = 5 \\<and> x mod 6 = 3} = 66", "step_time": 0.009498834609985352}, {"index": 5, "step": "let ?N = \"{x::nat. x < 50 \\<and> x mod 8 = 5 \\<and> x mod 6 = 3}\"", "output": "proof (state)\ngoal (1 subgoal):\n 1. \\<Sum> {x. x < 50 \\<and> x mod 8 = 5 \\<and> x mod 6 = 3} = 66", "step_time": 0.016596317291259766}, {"index": 6, "step": "\n  \n  (* Step 2: Find the elements of the set ?N by checking the congruences. *)\n  ", "output": "proof (state)\ngoal (1 subgoal):\n 1. \\<Sum> {x. x < 50 \\<and> x mod 8 = 5 \\<and> x mod 6 = 3} = 66", "step_time": 0.010100603103637695}, {"index": 7, "step": "have \"5 mod 8 = 5\" and \"3 mod 6 = 3\"", "output": "proof (prove)\ngoal (1 subgoal):\n 1.
