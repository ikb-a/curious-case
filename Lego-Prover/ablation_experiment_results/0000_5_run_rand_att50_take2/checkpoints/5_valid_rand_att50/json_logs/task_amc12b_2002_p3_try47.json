We can rewrite it as \\( (n-2)(n-1) \\).\n\nStep 2: Since \\( n \\) is a positive integer, both \\( n-1 \\) and \\( n-2 \\) are integers. One of these factors will be even and the other will be odd, as they are consecutive integers.\n\nStep 3: The product \\( (n-2)(n-1) \\) must yield an even number because the product of an even and an odd number is even.\n\nStep 4: The only even prime number is \\( 2 \\). Therefore, we need to find when \\( (n-2)(n-1) = 2 \\).\n\nStep 5: We can set up the equations:\n- Case 1: \\( n-2 = 1 \\) and \\( n-1 = 2 \\) leads to \\( n = 3 \\).\n- Case 2: \\( n-2 = 2 \\) and \\( n-1 = 1 \\) leads to \\( n = 0 \\) (not a positive integer).\n\nStep 6: The only solution that satisfies the condition of \\( n \\) being a positive integer is \\( n = 3 \\).\n\nStep 7: Thus, there is exactly one positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( n^2 - 3n + 2 \\) is a prime number, confirming that the answer is \\( \\mathrm{(B)}\\ \\text{one} \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem amc12b_2002_p3:\n  fixes n ::nat\n  assumes \"n>0\"\n    and prime:\"prime (n^2+2-3*n)\"\n  shows \"n=3\"\n```\n\n## Proof"}}
