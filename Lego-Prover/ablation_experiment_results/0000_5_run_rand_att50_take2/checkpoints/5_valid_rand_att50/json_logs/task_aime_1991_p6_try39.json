Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$.

The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us 73 terms in total.\n\nStep 2: Since the floor function can only take integer values, and the terms can differ by at most 1, we can denote the number of terms that equal 7 as \\( x \\) and those that equal 8 as \\( y \\). Thus, we have the equations:\n- \\( x + y = 73 \\)\n- \\( 7x + 8y = 546 \\)\n\nStep 3: Solve the system of equations. From the first equation, we can express \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\): \\( y = 73 - x \\). Substituting this into the second equation gives:\n\\[\n7x + 8(73 - x) = 546\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\n7x + 584 - 8x = 546 \\implies -x + 584 = 546 \\implies x = 38\n\\]\nThus, \\( y = 73 - 38 = 35 \\).\n\nStep 4: Interpret the results. This means there are 38 terms equal to 7 and 35 terms equal to 8. The first term that equals 8 occurs when \\( k = 57 \\), which gives us:\n\\[\n\\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 8\n\\]\nThis implies:\n\\[\n8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 9 \\implies 8 - \\frac{57}{100} \\leq r < 9 - \\frac{57}{100}\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\frac{743}{100} \\leq r < \\frac{744}{100}\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Conclude the result.

(For real $x^{}_{}$, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the [[floor function|greatest integer]] less than or equal to $x^{}_{}$.) Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the summation. The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us 73 terms in total.\n\nStep 2: Since the floor function can only take integer values, and the terms can differ by at most 1, we can denote the number of terms that equal 7 as \\( x \\) and those that equal 8 as \\( y \\). Thus, we have the equations:\n- \\( x + y = 73 \\)\n- \\( 7x + 8y = 546 \\)\n\nStep 3: Solve the system of equations. From the first equation, we can express \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\): \\( y = 73 - x \\). Substituting this into the second equation gives:\n\\[\n7x + 8(73 - x) = 546\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\n7x + 584 - 8x = 546 \\implies -x + 584 = 546 \\implies x = 38\n\\]\nThus, \\( y = 73 - 38 = 35 \\).\n\nStep 4: Interpret the results. This means there are 38 terms equal to 7 and 35 terms equal to 8. The first term that equals 8 occurs when \\( k = 57 \\), which gives us:\n\\[\n\\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 8\n\\]\nThis implies:\n\\[\n8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 9 \\implies 8 - \\frac{57}{100} \\leq r < 9 - \\frac{57}{100}\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\frac{743}{100} \\leq r < \\frac{744}{100}\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Conclude the result. Multiplying through by 100 gives:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744\n\\]\nThus, we have \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
