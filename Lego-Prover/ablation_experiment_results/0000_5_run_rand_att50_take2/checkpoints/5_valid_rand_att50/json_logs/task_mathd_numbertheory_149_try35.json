proof in response to a given problem statement.\nYour proof should be structured and clearly written, meeting the following criteria:\n- It can be verified by Isabelle.\n- Each step of the proof should be explained in detail using comments enclosed in \"(*\" and \"*)\".\n- The explanation for each step should be clear and concise, avoiding any unnecessary or apologetic language.\n- You are **strongly encouraged** to create useful and reusable lemmas to solve the problem.\n- The lemmas should be as general as possible (generalizable), and be able to cover a large step in proofs (non-trivial).\n- You **MUST** copy the input lemma EXACTLY: **without changing whitespace**, without paraphrasing, and without adding comments.\nPlease ensure that your proof is well-organized and easy to follow, with each step building upon the previous one.", "action_agent_human0": "Here some useful skill for reference:\n###### useful skill 1: ######\n```isabelle\nlemma mod_addition:\n  fixes
