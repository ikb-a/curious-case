Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$. Solving shows that $\\frac{743}{100} \\le r < \\frac{744}{100}$, so $743\\le 100r < 744$, and $\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us a total of \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the behavior of the floor function. Since the terms \\( \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\right\\rfloor \\) can differ by at most 1, the values of these terms can either be \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor = n \\).

Thus, the number of terms equal to \\( n \\) is \\( 73 - x \\).\n\nStep 4: Set up the equation:\n\\[\n(73 - x)n + x(n + 1) = 546.\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n73n + x = 546 \\implies x = 546 - 73n.\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Determine the bounds for \\( x \\). Since \\( x \\) must be non-negative and cannot exceed 73, we have:\n\\[\n0 \\leq 546 - 73n \\leq 73.\n\\]\nThis leads to two inequalities:\n1. \\( 546 - 73n \\geq 0 \\) implies \\( n \\leq \\frac{546}{73} \\approx 7.48 \\) so \\( n \\leq 7 \\).\n2. \\( 546 - 73n \\leq 73 \\) implies \\( n \\geq \\frac{473}{73} \\approx 6.48 \\) so \\( n \\geq 7 \\).\n\nStep 6: Conclude that \\( n = 7 \\). Thus, \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor = 7 \\).\n\nStep 7: Substitute \\( n = 7 \\) back into the equation for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = 546 - 73 \\cdot 7 = 547 - 511 = 35.\n\\]\nThis means there are 35 terms equal to 8 and \\( 73 - 35 = 38 \\) terms equal to 7.\n\nStep 8: Analyze the bounds for \\( r \\). The first term that equals 8 occurs at \\( k = 57 \\):\n\\[\n8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01 \\implies 8 - 0.57 < r < 8 - 0.57 + 0.01 \\implies 7.43 < r < 7.44.\n\\]\n\nStep 9: Multiply by 100 to find \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor \\):\n\\[\n743 < 100r < 744 \\implies \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743.\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
