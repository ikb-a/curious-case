We can rewrite it as \\( (n-1)(n-2) \\).\n\nStep 2: Analyze the factors \\( n-1 \\) and \\( n-2 \\). Since \\( n \\) is a positive integer, both \\( n-1 \\) and \\( n-2 \\) are non-negative integers. \n\nStep 3: Determine the conditions under which the product \\( (n-1)(n-2) \\) can be a prime number. A prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. Therefore, one of the factors must equal 1, and the other must equal the prime number itself.\n\nStep 4: Set up the equations based on the factorization:\n- If \\( n-1 = 1 \\), then \\( n = 2 \\) and \\( n-2 = 0 \\), which does not yield a prime.\n- If \\( n-2 = 1 \\), then \\( n = 3 \\) and \\( n-1 = 2 \\), which gives us \\( 2 \\times 1 = 2 \\), a prime number.\n\nStep 5: Check for other values of \\( n \\):\n- For \\( n = 1 \\), \\( n^2 - 3n + 2 = 0 \\) (not prime).\n- For \\( n = 2 \\), \\( n^2 - 3n + 2 = 0 \\) (not prime).\n- For \\( n = 3 \\), \\( n^2 - 3n + 2 = 2 \\) (prime).\n- For \\( n = 4 \\), \\( n^2 - 3n + 2 = 2 \\) (prime).\n- For \\( n \\geq 5 \\), both factors \\( n-1 \\) and \\( n-2 \\) are greater than 1, making their product composite.\n\nStep 6: Conclude that the only positive integer \\( n \\) for which \\( n^2 - 3n + 2 \\) is prime is \\( n = 3 \\). Thus, the answer is (B) one.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem amc12b_2002_p3:\n  fixes n ::nat\n  assumes \"n>0\"\n    and prime:\"prime (n^2+2-3*n)\"\n  shows \"n=3\"\n```\n\n## Proof"}}
