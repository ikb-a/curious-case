If their teacher puts them in groups of 8, the last group has 5 students. If their teacher instead puts them in groups of 6, the last group has 3 students. What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nWe are given that $N\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $N\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$.  We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer.

If their teacher puts them in groups of 8, the last group has 5 students. If their teacher instead puts them in groups of 6, the last group has 3 students. What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Set up the congruences based on the problem statement. We have:\n- \\( N \\equiv 5 \\mod 8 \\) (since the last group of 8 has 5 students)\n- \\( N \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\) (since the last group of 6 has 3 students)\n\nStep 2: Express \\( N \\) in terms of the first congruence:\n- Let \\( N = 8k + 5 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nStep 3: Substitute \\( N \\) into the second congruence:\n- \\( 8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\)\n- Simplifying gives \\( 2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\) (since \\( 8 \\equiv 2 \\mod 6 \\))\n- This simplifies to \\( 2k \\equiv -2 \\mod 6 \\) or \\( 2k \\equiv 4 \\mod 6 \\).\n\nStep 4: Divide the entire equation by 2:\n- \\( k \\equiv 2 \\mod 3 \\).\n\nStep 5: Express \\( k \\) in terms of another integer:\n- Let \\( k = 3m + 2 \\) for some integer \\( m \\).\n\nStep 6: Substitute back to find \\( N \\):\n- \\( N = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21 \\).\n\nStep 7: Determine the possible values of \\( N \\) under the constraint \\( N < 50 \\):\n- For \\( m = 0 \\): \\( N = 21 \\)\n- For \\( m = 1 \\): \\( N = 45 \\)\n- For \\( m = 2 \\): \\( N = 69 \\) (not valid since \\( N < 50 \\))\n\nStep 8: The valid values of \\( N \\) are 21 and 45. \n\nStep 9: Calculate the sum of all possible values of \\( N \\):\n- \\( 21 + 45 = 66 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n```\n\n## Proof", "action_agent_ai0": "```isabelle\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_149\n  imports Complex_Main\nbegin\n\n(* Step 1: Set up the congruences based on the problem statement.
