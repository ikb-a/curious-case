This simplifies the expression since $b$ can only be 0, 1, or 2.\nStep 2: State that $a^2 \\mod 3 = b^2 \\mod 3$, which can be proved using the properties of modulo arithmetic.\nStep 3: Enumerate the cases for $b$, i.e., $b = 0$, $b = 1$, or $b = 2$.\nStep 4: For each case, calculate $b^2 \\mod 3$.
