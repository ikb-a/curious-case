Since $531 = 106 \\cdot 5 + 1,\\ 753 = 150 \\cdot 5 + 3,\\ 975 = 194 \\cdot 5 + 5$, it follows that  $$x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975} = (-1)^{106} x_1 + (-1)^{150} x_3 + (-1)^{194} x_5 = 211 + 420 + 267 = 898.$$\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem\n  fixes x :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> int\"\n  assumes h0 : \"x 1 = 211\"\n    and h1 : \"x 2 = 375\"\n    and h2 : \"x 3 = 420\"\n    and h3 : \"x 4 = 523\"\n    and h4 : \"\\<And>(n::nat).

What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nWe are given that $N\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $N\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$.  We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer.

What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: We start with the recurrence relation given for \\( n \\geq 5 \\):\n\\[\nx_n = x_{n-1} - x_{n-2} + x_{n-3} - x_{n-4}\n\\]\n\nStep 2: We will derive a relationship for \\( x_n \\) in terms of \\( x_{n-5} \\). By substituting \\( n \\) with \\( n-1 \\), \\( n-2 \\), \\( n-3 \\), and \\( n-4 \\) in the recurrence relation, we can express \\( x_{n-1}, x_{n-2}, x_{n-3}, \\) and \\( x_{n-4} \\) in terms of \\( x_{n-5} \\):\n\\[\nx_{n-1} = x_{n-2} - x_{n-3} + x_{n-4} - x_{n-5}\n\\]\nContinuing this process, we find that:\n\\[\nx_n = -x_{n-5}\n\\]\n\nStep 3: We can now express \\( x_n \\) in terms of \\( x_{n-5k} \\) for \\( k \\geq 0 \\):\n\\[\nx_n = (-1)^k x_{n-5k}\n\\]\n\nStep 4: We will now evaluate \\( x_{531}, x_{753}, \\) and \\( x_{975} \\):\n- For \\( x_{531} \\):\n  \\[\n  531 = 5 \\cdot 106 + 1 \\implies x_{531} = (-1)^{106} x_1 = 211\n  \\]\n- For \\( x_{753} \\):\n  \\[\n  753 = 5 \\cdot 150 + 3 \\implies x_{753} = (-1)^{150} x_3 = 420\n  \\]\n- For \\( x_{975} \\):\n  \\[\n  975 = 5 \\cdot 194 + 5 \\implies x_{975} = (-1)^{194} x_5 = 267\n  \\]\n\nStep 5: Now we sum these values:\n\\[\nx_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975} = 211 + 420 + 267 = 898\n\\]\n\nThus, we have shown that \\( x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975} = 898 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n```\n\n## Proof", "action_agent_ai0": "```isabelle\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_149\n  imports Complex_Main\nbegin\n\n(* formal statement copy from the input *)\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\nproof -\n  (* Step 1: We will find the values of N that satisfy the two conditions: N mod 8 = 5 and N mod 6 = 3. *)\n  let ?S = \"{x::nat. x < 50 \\<and> x mod 8 = 5 \\<and> x mod 6 = 3}\"\n  \n  (* Step 2: We can express N in the form of its constraints.
