We can write the equations as $\\frac{c}{3} + 2*\\frac{d}{2}=5$ and $\\frac{d}{3} + 2*\\frac{c}{2}=7$. Solving the equations and we get $c=6$ and $d=3$. Hence $a=2^6=64$ and $b=2^3=8$.

Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$ Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$.

If their teacher puts them in groups of 8, the last group has 5 students. If their teacher instead puts them in groups of 6, the last group has 3 students. What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: We start with the congruences given in the problem: \\( N \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8} \\) and \\( N \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6} \\).\n\nStep 2: To find values of \\( N \\) that satisfy both congruences, we can express \\( N \\) in terms of the first congruence. Let \\( N = 8k + 5 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nStep 3: Substitute \\( N \\) into the second congruence:\n\\[\n8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6}\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6}\n\\]\nSubtracting 5 from both sides gives:\n\\[\n2k \\equiv -2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{6}\n\\]\nDividing by 2 (noting that 2 has an inverse modulo 6) gives:\n\\[\nk \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Express \\( k \\) in terms of another integer \\( m \\):\n\\[\nk = 3m + 2\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Substitute back into the expression for \\( N \\):\n\\[\nN = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Now we need to find values of \\( N \\) that are less than 50:\n\\[\n24m + 21 < 50\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n24m < 29 \\implies m < \\frac{29}{24} \\implies m = 0\n\\]\nThus, for \\( m = 0 \\):\n\\[\nN = 21\n\\]\n\nStep 7: Check the next integer \\( m = 1 \\):\n\\[\nN = 24(1) + 21 = 45\n\\]\nSince \\( 45 < 50 \\), this is also a valid solution.\n\nStep 8: The possible values of \\( N \\) are 21 and 45. Their sum is:\n\\[\n21 + 45 = 66\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n```\n\n## Proof", "action_agent_ai0": "```isabelle\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_149\nimports Complex_Main\nbegin\n\n(* formal statement copy from the input *)\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\nproof -\n  (* We start by defining the set of possible values of N that satisfy the conditions. *)\n  let ?S = \"{x::nat. x < 50 \\<and> x mod 8 = 5 \\<and> x mod 6 = 3}\"\n  \n  (* We will show that the values of N satisfying the congruences are 21 and 45. *)\n  \n  (* First, we can list the possible values of N that satisfy N mod 8 = 5. *)\n  have \"finite ?S\" by auto\n  then have \"card ?S > 0\" \n    using finite_nat_set by auto\n  \n  (* Now we find the elements of the set.
