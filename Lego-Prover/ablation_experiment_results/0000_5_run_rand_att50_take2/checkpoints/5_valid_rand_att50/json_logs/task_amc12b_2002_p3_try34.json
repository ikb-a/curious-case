The base case is trivial. Inductive case: when n is 0 it is also trivial. When $n>0$, let $m=2^n$, and we have $3^m - 1 \\equiv 4*m \\pmod{8*m}$. Then there is $k$ where $3^m - 1 = (8*m)*k + 4*m$. Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$ Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$.

Since \\(n\\) is a positive integer, both factors are integers. \n\nStep 3: Note that one of the factors, either \\(n-1\\) or \\(n-2\\), must be even, while the other is odd. This means their product \\((n-2)(n-1)\\) is even.\n\nStep 4: The only even prime number is \\(2\\). Therefore, we set up the equation \\((n-2)(n-1) = 2\\).\n\nStep 5: Solve the equation \\((n-2)(n-1) = 2\\). The possible pairs of factors of \\(2\\) are:\n- \\(1 \\cdot 2\\)\n- \\(2 \\cdot 1\\)\n\nStep 6: For the pair \\(1 \\cdot 2\\):\n- \\(n-2 = 1\\) and \\(n-1 = 2\\) gives \\(n = 3\\).\n\nStep 7: For the pair \\(2 \\cdot 1\\):\n- \\(n-2 = 2\\) and \\(n-1 = 1\\) gives \\(n = 4\\), which does not satisfy the condition since \\(4-2 = 2\\) and \\(4-1 = 3\\) (both are not prime).\n\nStep 8: Conclude that the only positive integer \\(n\\) for which \\(n^2 - 3n + 2\\) is prime is \\(n = 3\\).\n\nStep 9: Therefore, the answer is \\(\\mathrm{(B)}\\) one.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem amc12b_2002_p3:\n  fixes n ::nat\n  assumes \"n>0\"\n    and prime:\"prime (n^2+2-3*n)\"\n  shows \"n=3\"\n```\n\n## Proof"}}
