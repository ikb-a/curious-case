Since $531 = 106 \\cdot 5 + 1,\\ 753 = 150 \\cdot 5 + 3,\\ 975 = 194 \\cdot 5 + 5$, it follows that  $$x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975} = (-1)^{106} x_1 + (-1)^{150} x_3 + (-1)^{194} x_5 = 211 + 420 + 267 = 898.$$\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem\n  fixes x :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> int\"\n  assumes h0 : \"x 1 = 211\"\n    and h1 : \"x 2 = 375\"\n    and h2 : \"x 3 = 420\"\n    and h3 : \"x 4 = 523\"\n    and h4 : \"\\<And>(n::nat).

What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nWe are given that $N\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $N\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$.  We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer.

Let \\( N = 8k + 5 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nStep 3: Substitute \\( N \\) into the second congruence:\n\\[\n8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6.\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6.\n\\]\nSubtracting 5 from both sides gives:\n\\[\n2k \\equiv -2 \\mod 6 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 2k \\equiv 4 \\mod 6.\n\\]\nDividing by 2 (noting that 2 and 6 are coprime) gives:\n\\[\nk \\equiv 2 \\mod 3.\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Express \\( k \\) in terms of another integer \\( m \\):\n\\[\nk = 3m + 2 \\quad \\text{for some integer } m.\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Substitute back into the expression for \\( N \\):\n\\[\nN = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21.\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Now we need to find values of \\( N \\) that are less than 50:\n\\[\n24m + 21 < 50 \\implies 24m < 29 \\implies m < \\frac{29}{24} \\implies m = 0 \\text{ or } 1.\n\\]\n\nStep 7: Calculate the possible values of \\( N \\):\n- For \\( m = 0 \\): \\( N = 24(0) + 21 = 21 \\).\n- For \\( m = 1 \\): \\( N = 24(1) + 21 = 45 \\).\n\nStep 8: The possible values of \\( N \\) are 21 and 45. Their sum is:\n\\[\n21 + 45 = 66.\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n```\n\n## Proof", "action_agent_ai0": "```isabelle\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_149\n  imports Complex_Main\nbegin\n\n(* Step 1: We start with the congruences given in the problem: \\( N \\equiv 5 \\mod 8 \\) and \\( N \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\). *)\nlemma congruences:\n  fixes N :: nat\n  assumes \"N mod 8 = 5\" \"N mod 6 = 3\"\n  shows \"N = 8k + 5\" for some integer k\nproof -\n  show ?thesis by (metis assms(1) mod_eq_0_iff_dvd)\nqed\n\n(* Step 2: To find values of \\( N \\) that satisfy these congruences, we can express \\( N \\) in terms of the first congruence.
