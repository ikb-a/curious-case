It suffices to show $\\sqrt{2} \\leq x + \\frac{1}{2x}$. Let $y = \\sqrt{2}$. $y*y = 2$. Then $2x*x + 1 - 2x * \\sqrt{2} = y*y * x*x + 1 - 2xy = (xy - 1)^2 \\geq 0$. Also notice that $2x*x + 1 - 2x * \\sqrt{2} = 2x * (x + \\frac{1}{2x} - \\sqrt{2})$. Therefore $x + \\frac{1}{2x} - \\sqrt{2} \\geq 0$, given $2x > 0$.

task is to provide a formal proof in response to a given problem statement.\nYour proof should be structured and clearly written, meeting the following criteria:\n- It can be verified by Isabelle.\n- Each step of the proof should be explained in detail using comments enclosed in \"(*\" and \"*)\".\n- The explanation for each step should be clear and concise, avoiding any unnecessary or apologetic language.\n- You are **strongly encouraged** to create useful and reusable lemmas to solve the problem.\n- The lemmas should be as general as possible (generalizable), and be able to cover a large step in proofs (non-trivial).\n- You **MUST** copy the input lemma EXACTLY: **without changing whitespace**, without paraphrasing, and without adding comments.\nPlease ensure that your proof is well-organized and easy to follow, with each step building upon the previous one.", "action_agent_human0": "Here some useful skill for reference:\n###### useful skill 1: ######\n```isabelle\nlemma

We can rewrite it as \\( (n-1)(n-2) \\).\n\nStep 2: Analyze the factors \\( n-1 \\) and \\( n-2 \\). Since \\( n \\) is a positive integer, both \\( n-1 \\) and \\( n-2 \\) are non-negative integers.\n\nStep 3: Note that one of the factors \\( n-1 \\) or \\( n-2 \\) is odd and the other is even. The product of an even number and an odd number is even.\n\nStep 4: The only even prime number is \\( 2 \\). Therefore, we need to find when \\( (n-1)(n-2) = 2 \\).\n\nStep 5: Set up the equation \\( (n-1)(n-2) = 2 \\). The pairs of factors of \\( 2 \\) are \\( (1, 2) \\) and \\( (2, 1) \\).\n\nStep 6: Solve for \\( n \\):\n- If \\( n-1 = 1 \\) and \\( n-2 = 2 \\), then \\( n = 2 \\) (not valid since \\( n-2 \\) must be \\( 0 \\)).\n- If \\( n-1 = 2 \\) and \\( n-2 = 1 \\), then \\( n = 3 \\) (valid).\n\nStep 7: Check if there are any other positive integers \\( n \\) such that \\( (n-1)(n-2) \\) is prime. For \\( n \\geq 4 \\), both factors \\( n-1 \\) and \\( n-2 \\) are greater than \\( 1 \\), making their product greater than \\( 2 \\) and thus not prime.\n\nStep 8: Conclude that the only positive integer \\( n \\) for which \\( n^2 - 3n + 2 \\) is prime is \\( n = 3 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem amc12b_2002_p3:\n  fixes n ::nat\n  assumes \"n>0\"\n    and prime:\"prime (n^2+2-3*n)\"\n  shows \"n=3\"\n```\n\n## Proof"}}
