The base case is trivial. Inductive case: when n is 0 it is also trivial. When $n>0$, let $m=2^n$, and we have $3^m - 1 \\equiv 4*m \\pmod{8*m}$. Then there is $k$ where $3^m - 1 = (8*m)*k + 4*m$. Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$ Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$. Therefore the inductive case holds.

If their teacher puts them in groups of 8, the last group has 5 students. If their teacher instead puts them in groups of 6, the last group has 3 students. What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nWe are given that $N\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $N\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$.  We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer.

If their teacher puts them in groups of 8, the last group has 5 students. If their teacher instead puts them in groups of 6, the last group has 3 students. What is the sum of all possible values of $N$?

Their sum is:\n\\[\n21 + 45 = 66\n\\]\n\nStep 9: Conclude that the sum of all possible values of \\( N \\) is \\( 66 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n```\n\n## Proof", "action_agent_ai0": "```isabelle\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_149\n  imports Complex_Main\nbegin\n\n(* formal statement copy from the input *)\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\nproof -\n  (* Step 1: We start with the congruences given in the problem: \\( N \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8} \\) and \\( N \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6} \\). *)\n  let ?N = \"x::nat\"\n  \n  (* Step 2: From the first congruence, we can express \\( N \\) in the form: \\( N = 8k + 5 \\) for some integer \\( k \\). *)\n  have \"\u2203k. ?N = 8*k + 5\" by (metis mod_eq_iff_add_eq_0)\n\n  (* Step 3: Substitute this expression into the second congruence: \\( 8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6} \\) *)\n  have \"8*k + 5 mod 6 = 3\" (* We will simplify the congruence *)\n    by (simp add: mod_add)\n\n  (* This simplifies to: \\( 2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6} \\) *)\n  have \"2*k + 5 mod 6 = 3\" by (simp add: mod_mult_self2)\n\n  (* Step 4: Further simplify: \\( 2k \\equiv -2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{6} \\) *)\n  have \"2*k mod 6 = 4\" by (simp add: mod_0)\n\n  (* Thus, we have: \\( k \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3} \\) *)\n  have \"k mod 3 = 2\" by (metis mod_eq_iff_add_eq_0)\n\n  (* Step 5: We can express \\( k \\) in terms of another integer \\( m \\): \\( k = 3m + 2 \\) for some integer \\( m \\). *)\n  let ?m = \"m::nat\"\n  have \"k = 3*m + 2\" by (metis nat_ex)\n\n  (* Step 6: Substitute back into the expression for \\( N \\): \\( N = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 21 \\) *)\n  have \"?N = 24*m + 21\" by (simp add: algebra_simps)\n\n  (* Step 7: We need to find values of \\( N \\) such that \\( N < 50 \\): \\( 24m + 21 < 50 \\) *)\n  have \"24*m + 21 < 50 \u27f7 24*m < 29 \u27f7 m < 29/24\" by (simp add: less_trans)\n\n  (* Thus, \\( m = 0 \\) is the only viable candidate. *)\n  have \"m = 0\" by (simp add: less_le)\n\n  (* Therefore, for \\( m = 0 \\): \\( N = 21 \\) *)\n  have \"N = 21\" by (simp add: algebra_simps)\n\n  (* Step 8: Now, check for \\( m = 1 \\): \\( N = 24(1) + 21 = 45 \\) *)\n  have \"N = 24*1 + 21 = 45\" by (simp add: algebra_simps)\n\n  (* This is also less than 50. *)\n  have \"N < 50\" by (simp add: less_le)\n\n  (* Step 9: The possible values of \\( N \\) are \\( 21 \\) and \\( 45 \\).
