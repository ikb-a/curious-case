Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$. Solving shows that $\\frac{743}{100} \\le r < \\frac{744}{100}$, so $743\\le 100r < 744$, and $\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

(For real $x^{}_{}$, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the [[floor function|greatest integer]] less than or equal to $x^{}_{}$.) Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the summation. The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us a total of \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that the floor function can yield either \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) as \\( n \\) or \\( n + 1 \\) for consecutive values of \\( k \\). Since the terms can differ by at most 1, we can denote the number of terms that equal \\( n \\) as \\( x \\) and those that equal \\( n + 1 \\) as \\( y \\).\n\nStep 3: Set up the equations based on the total number of terms and the total sum:\n- \\( x + y = 73 \\)\n- \\( nx + (n + 1)y = 546 \\)\n\nStep 4: Substitute \\( y = 73 - x \\) into the second equation:\n\\[\nnx + (n + 1)(73 - x) = 546\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\nnx + 73n + 73 - nx - x = 546\n\\]\nwhich leads to:\n\\[\n73n + 73 - x = 546\n\\]\nThus, we have:\n\\[\nx = 73n + 73 - 546 = 73n - 473\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Since \\( x \\) must be non-negative, we derive:\n\\[\n73n - 473 \\geq 0 \\implies n \\geq \\frac{473}{73} \\approx 6.5\n\\]\nThus, \\( n \\) must be at least 7.\n\nStep 6: Calculate the maximum possible value of \\( n \\). The maximum value of \\( y \\) occurs when \\( x \\) is minimized. If \\( n = 7 \\):\n\\[\nx = 73(7) - 473 = 511 - 473 = 38\n\\]\nThen \\( y = 73 - 38 = 35 \\).\n\nStep 7: If \\( n = 7 \\), then the sum becomes:\n\\[\n7 \\cdot 38 + 8 \\cdot 35 = 266 + 280 = 546\n\\]\nThis confirms that \\( n = 7 \\) is valid.\n\nStep 8: Now, we analyze the bounds for \\( r \\):\n\\[\n7 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8 \\implies 7 - \\frac{57}{100} < r < 8 - \\frac{57}{100}\n\\]\nThis gives:\n\\[\n\\frac{643}{100} < r < \\frac{743}{100}\n\\]\n\nStep 9: Multiply through by 100 to find bounds for \\( 100r \\):\n\\[\n643 < 100r < 743\n\\]\nThus, \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

The base case is trivial. Inductive case: when n is 0 it is also trivial. When $n>0$, let $m=2^n$, and we have $3^m - 1 \\equiv 4*m \\pmod{8*m}$. Then there is $k$ where $3^m - 1 = (8*m)*k + 4*m$. Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$ Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$.

(For real $x^{}_{}$, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the [[floor function|greatest integer]] less than or equal to $x^{}_{}$.) Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the summation. The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us a total of \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that the floor function can yield either \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) as \\( n \\) or \\( n + 1 \\) for consecutive values of \\( k \\). Since the terms can differ by at most 1, we can denote the number of terms that equal \\( n \\) as \\( x \\) and those that equal \\( n + 1 \\) as \\( y \\).\n\nStep 3: Set up the equations based on the total number of terms and the total sum:\n- \\( x + y = 73 \\)\n- \\( nx + (n + 1)y = 546 \\)\n\nStep 4: Substitute \\( y = 73 - x \\) into the second equation:\n\\[\nnx + (n + 1)(73 - x) = 546\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\nnx + 73n + 73 - nx - x = 546\n\\]\nwhich leads to:\n\\[\n73n + 73 - x = 546\n\\]\nThus, we have:\n\\[\nx = 73n + 73 - 546 = 73n - 473\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Since \\( x \\) must be non-negative, we derive:\n\\[\n73n - 473 \\geq 0 \\implies n \\geq \\frac{473}{73} \\approx 6.5\n\\]\nThus, \\( n \\) must be at least 7.\n\nStep 6: Calculate the maximum possible value of \\( n \\). The maximum value of \\( y \\) occurs when \\( x \\) is minimized. If \\( n = 7 \\):\n\\[\nx = 73(7) - 473 = 511 - 473 = 38\n\\]\nThen \\( y = 73 - 38 = 35 \\).\n\nStep 7: If \\( n = 7 \\), then the sum becomes:\n\\[\n7 \\cdot 38 + 8 \\cdot 35 = 266 + 280 = 546\n\\]\nThis confirms that \\( n = 7 \\) is valid.\n\nStep 8: Now, we analyze the bounds for \\( r \\):\n\\[\n7 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8 \\implies 7 - \\frac{57}{100} < r < 8 - \\frac{57}{100}\n\\]\nThis gives:\n\\[\n\\frac{643}{100} < r < \\frac{743}{100}\n\\]\n\nStep 9: Multiply through by 100 to find bounds for \\( 100r \\):\n\\[\n643 < 100r < 743\n\\]\nThus, \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
