Substituting into one of the given equations, we have $x+xy=5$ $x(1+y)=5$ $\\frac{1}{x}=\\frac{1+y}{5}.$ we can substitute back into $y+\\frac{1}{x}=29$ to obtain $y+\\frac{1+y}{5}=29$ $5y+1+y=145$ $y=24.$ We can then substitute once again to get $x=\\frac15$ $z=\\frac{5}{24}.$ Thus, $z+\\frac1y=\\frac{5}{24}+\\frac{1}{24}=\\frac{1}{4}$, so $m+n=005$.\n\n## Formal statement\ntheorem\n  fixes x y z :: real\n    and p :: rat\n  assumes \"0 < x \\<and> 0 < y \\<and> 0 < z\"\n    and \"x * y * z = 1\"\n    and \"x + 1 / z = 5\"\n    and \"y + 1 / x = 29\"\n    and \"z + 1 / y = p\"\n    and \"0 < p\" \n  shows \"let (m,n) = quotient_of p in m + n = 5\"\n\n## Structured informal proof\nStep 1: Rewrite the equation $xyz = 1$ as $\\frac{1}{z} = xy$.\nStep 2: Substitute the value of $\\frac{1}{z}$ into the equation $x + \\frac{1}{z} = 5$, resulting in $x + xy = 5$ then $x(1 + y) = 5$.\nStep 3: Solve for $\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{1 + y}{5}$.\nStep 4: Substitute the value of $\\frac{1}{x}$ into the equation $y + \\frac{1}{x} = 29$, leading to $y + \\frac{1+y}{5} = 29$.\nStep 5: Solve for $y$, getting $y = 24$.\nStep 6: Substitute the value of $y$ back into the equations to find $x = \\frac{1}{5}$ and $z = \\frac{5}{24}$.\nStep 7: Find $z + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{5}{24} + \\frac{1}{24} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nStep 8: The rational $p = \\frac{1}{4}$ can be expressed as $p = \\frac{m}{n}$ where $m = 1$ and $n = 4$.

If their teacher puts them in groups of 8, the last group has 5 students. If their teacher instead puts them in groups of 6, the last group has 3 students. What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nWe are given that $N\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $N\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$.  We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer. Thus the 2 solutions less than $50$ are 21 and $21+24(1) = 45$, and their sum is $21+45=66$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n```\n", "ai0": "## Structured informal proof\nStep 1: We start with the congruences given in the problem: \\( N \\equiv 5 \\mod{8} \\) and \\( N \\equiv 3 \\mod{6} \\).\n\nStep 2: From the first congruence, we can express \\( N \\) in the form \\( N = 8k + 5 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nStep 3: Substitute \\( N \\) into the second congruence: \n\\[\n8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod{6}.\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod{6} \\implies 2k \\equiv -2 \\equiv 4 \\mod{6}.\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Dividing both sides of \\( 2k \\equiv 4 \\mod{6} \\) by 2 gives:\n\\[\nk \\equiv 2 \\mod{3}.\n\\]\nThus, we can express \\( k \\) as \\( k = 3m + 2 \\) for some integer \\( m \\).\n\nStep 5: Substitute back into the expression for \\( N \\):\n\\[\nN = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21.\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Now we need to find values of \\( N \\) such that \\( N < 50 \\):\n\\[\n24m + 21 < 50 \\implies 24m < 29 \\implies m < \\frac{29}{24} \\implies m = 0.\n\\]\nThus, for \\( m = 0 \\), we have \\( N = 21 \\).\n\nStep 7: Check for \\( m = 1 \\):\n\\[\nN = 24(1) + 21 = 45.\n\\]\nThis is also less than 50.\n\nStep 8: The possible values of \\( N \\) are \\( 21 \\) and \\( 45 \\). \n\nStep 9: Finally, we sum these values:\n\\[\n21 + 45 = 66.\n\\]\n\n## Request skills\n### Thoughts 1\nThe ability to solve systems of congruences is essential for this problem, particularly using substitution and the Chinese Remainder Theorem.\n\n### Code 1\n```isabelle\nlemma solve_congruences:\n  fixes N :: nat\n  assumes \"N mod 8 = 5\" \"N mod 6 = 3\" \"N < 50\"\n  shows \"N = 21 \\<or> N = 45\"\n```\n\n### Thoughts 2\nUnderstanding the properties of modular arithmetic and how to manipulate congruences will be beneficial in deriving the solution.\n\n### Code 2\n```isabelle\nlemma modular_arithmetic:\n  fixes a b m :: nat\n  assumes \"a mod m = b\"\n  shows \"a = k * m + b\" for some integer k\n```\n\n### Thoughts 3\nA lemma to help with the bounds on \\( N \\) based on the derived expressions would be useful.\n\n### Code 3\n```isabelle\nlemma bound_n:\n  fixes m :: nat\n  assumes \"N = 24 * m + 21\" \"N < 50\"\n  shows \"m = 0 \\<or> m = 1\"\n```"}, "task": "data/full_data/debug/valid_rand/mathd_numbertheory_149.json", "success": false, "conversations": [["As a mathematician familiar with Isabelle, your task is to provide a formal proof in response to a given problem statement.\nYour proof should be structured and clearly written, meeting the following criteria:\n- It can be verified by Isabelle.\n- Each step of the proof should be explained in detail using comments enclosed in \"(*\" and \"*)\".\n- The explanation for each step should be clear and concise, avoiding any unnecessary or apologetic language.\n- You are **strongly encouraged** to create useful and reusable lemmas to solve the problem.\n- The lemmas should be as general as possible (generalizable), and be able to cover a large step in proofs (non-trivial).\n- You **MUST** copy the input lemma EXACTLY: **without changing whitespace**, without paraphrasing, and without adding comments.\nPlease ensure that your proof is well-organized and easy to follow, with each step building upon the previous one.", "Here some useful skill for reference:\n###### useful skill 1: ######\n```isabelle\nlemma bounds_on_N:\n  fixes m :: nat\n  assumes \"N = 24 * m + 21\" \"N < 50\"\n  shows \"m < 2\"\nproof -\n  from assms(2) have \"N < 50\" by simp\n  hence \"24 * m + 21 < 50\" using assms(1) by simp\n  thus ?thesis\n  proof -\n    have \"24 * m < 50 -

What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: We start with the congruences given in the problem: \\( N \\equiv 5 \\mod{8} \\) and \\( N \\equiv 3 \\mod{6} \\).\n\nStep 2: From the first congruence, we can express \\( N \\) in the form \\( N = 8k + 5 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nStep 3: Substitute \\( N \\) into the second congruence: \n\\[\n8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod{6}.\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod{6} \\implies 2k \\equiv -2 \\equiv 4 \\mod{6}.\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Dividing both sides of \\( 2k \\equiv 4 \\mod{6} \\) by 2 gives:\n\\[\nk \\equiv 2 \\mod{3}.\n\\]\nThus, we can express \\( k \\) as \\( k = 3m + 2 \\) for some integer \\( m \\).\n\nStep 5: Substitute back into the expression for \\( N \\):\n\\[\nN = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21.\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Now we need to find values of \\( N \\) such that \\( N < 50 \\):\n\\[\n24m + 21 < 50 \\implies 24m < 29 \\implies m < \\frac{29}{24} \\implies m = 0.\n\\]\nThus, for \\( m =
