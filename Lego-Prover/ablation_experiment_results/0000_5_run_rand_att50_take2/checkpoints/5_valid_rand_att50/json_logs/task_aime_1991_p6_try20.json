Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$.

(For real $x^{}_{}$, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the [[floor function|greatest integer]] less than or equal to $x^{}_{}$.) Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the summation. The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us a total of \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the values of the floor function. Since the terms \\( \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\right\\rfloor \\) can only differ by at most 1, the values can either be \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( n = \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\). Then, we can express the sum as:\n\\[\nx \\cdot n + (73 - x) \\cdot (n + 1) = 546\n\\]\nwhere \\( x \\) is the number of terms equal to \\( n + 1 \\).\n\nStep 4: Simplifying the equation gives:\n\\[\nx \\cdot n + 73 - x + x = 546 \\implies x \\cdot n + 73 - x = 546 \\implies x(n - 1) + 73 = 546\n\\]\nThus, we have:\n\\[\nx(n - 1) = 473 \\implies x = \\frac{473}{n - 1}\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Since \\( x \\) must be an integer, \\( n - 1 \\) must divide 473. The divisors of 473 are 1, 11, 43, and 473, leading to possible values for \\( n \\) as 2, 12, 44, and 474.\n\nStep 6: Calculate \\( n \\) for each divisor:\n- If \\( n - 1 = 1 \\), then \\( n = 2 \\) and \\( x = 473 \\) (not possible since \\( x \\) cannot exceed 73).\n- If \\( n - 1 = 11 \\), then \\( n = 12 \\) and \\( x = 43 \\) (valid).\n- If \\( n - 1 = 43 \\), then \\( n = 44 \\) and \\( x = 11 \\) (valid).\n- If \\( n - 1 = 473 \\), then \\( n = 474 \\) and \\( x = 1 \\) (not possible since \\( x \\) cannot exceed 73).\n\nStep 7: For \\( n = 12 \\) and \\( x = 43 \\):\n- The remaining \\( 73 - 43 = 30 \\) terms must be equal to 12.\n- The values of \\( r + \\frac{19}{100} \\) to \\( r + \\frac{91}{100} \\) must be such that 43 of them round to 13 and 30 round to 12.\n\nStep 8: The first term that rounds to 13 is \\( r + \\frac{57}{100} \\), which gives:\n\\[\n12.00 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 13.00 \\implies 11.43 \\leq r < 12.00\n\\]\n\nStep 9: This implies:\n\\[\n\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 1143 \\text{ to } 1200\n\\]\n\nStep 10: For \\( n = 44 \\) and \\( x = 11 \\):\n- The remaining \\( 73 - 11 = 62 \\) terms must be equal to 44.\n- The first term that rounds to 45 is \\( r + \\frac{19 + 11 - 1}{100} = r + \\frac{29}{100} \\).\n\nStep 11: This gives:\n\\[\n44.00 \\leq r + \\frac{29}{100} < 45.00 \\implies 43.71 \\leq r < 44.00\n\\]\n\nStep 12: This implies:\n\\[\n\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 4371 \\text{ to } 4400\n\\]\n\nStep 13: Since \\( r \\) must be consistent with both cases, we find that the only valid solution is \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
