Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$ Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$.

We can rewrite it as \\( (n-1)(n-2) \\).\n\nStep 2: Analyze the factors \\( n-1 \\) and \\( n-2 \\). Since \\( n \\) is a positive integer, both \\( n-1 \\) and \\( n-2 \\) are non-negative integers.\n\nStep 3: Note that one of the factors \\( n-1 \\) or \\( n-2 \\) is odd and the other is even. The product of an even number and an odd number is even.\n\nStep 4: The only even prime number is \\( 2 \\). Therefore, we need to find when \\( (n-1)(n-2) = 2 \\).\n\nStep 5: Set up the equation \\( (n-1)(n-2) = 2 \\). This gives us two cases to consider:\n- Case 1: \\( n-1 = 2 \\) and \\( n-2 = 1 \\) which leads to \\( n = 3 \\).\n- Case 2: \\( n-1 = 1 \\) and \\( n-2 = 2 \\) which leads to \\( n = 4 \\) (not valid since \\( 4-2 = 2 \\) is not prime).\n\nStep 6: Check if \\( n = 3 \\) yields a prime number. Substituting \\( n = 3 \\) into the original expression gives \\( 3^2 - 3 \\cdot 3 + 2 = 2 \\), which is prime.\n\nStep 7: Conclude that the only positive integer \\( n \\) for which \\( n^2 - 3n + 2 \\) is prime is \\( n = 3 \\). Thus, the answer is \\( \\text{(B)}\\ \\text{one} \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem amc12b_2002_p3:\n  fixes n ::nat\n  assumes \"n>0\"\n    and prime:\"prime (n^2+2-3*n)\"\n  shows \"n=3\"\n```\n\n## Proof"}}
