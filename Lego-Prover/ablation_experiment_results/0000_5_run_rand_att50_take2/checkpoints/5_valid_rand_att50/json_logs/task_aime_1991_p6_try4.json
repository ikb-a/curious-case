Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$.

The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us a total of \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that since the terms \\( \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\right\\rfloor \\) can only differ by at most 1, the values of these terms must be either \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( n = \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\). Then, we can express the sum as:\n\\[\nx \\cdot n + y \\cdot (n + 1) = 546\n\\]\nwhere \\( x \\) is the number of terms equal to \\( n \\) and \\( y \\) is the number of terms equal to \\( n + 1 \\). Since \\( x + y = 73 \\), we can substitute \\( y = 73 - x \\).\n\nStep 4: Substitute \\( y \\) into the equation:\n\\[\nx \\cdot n + (73 - x) \\cdot (n + 1) = 546\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\nx \\cdot n + 73n + 73 - x \\cdot n - 73 = 546\n\\]\nwhich further simplifies to:\n\\[\n73n = 546\n\\]\nThus, we find:\n\\[\nn = \\frac{546}{73} = 7 \\quad \\text{(with a remainder of 35)}\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Since \\( n = 7 \\), we have \\( 35 \\) terms equal to \\( 8 \\) and \\( 38 \\) terms equal to \\( 7 \\). The first term that equals \\( 8 \\) occurs when \\( k = 57 \\):\n\\[\n\\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 8\n\\]\nThis implies:\n\\[\n8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01\n\\]\nFrom this, we can derive:\n\\[\n8 - \\frac{57}{100} \\leq r < 8.01 - \\frac{57}{100}\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\frac{743}{100} \\leq r < \\frac{744}{100}\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Finally, multiplying through by 100 gives:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744\n\\]\nThus, we conclude:\n\\[\n\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
