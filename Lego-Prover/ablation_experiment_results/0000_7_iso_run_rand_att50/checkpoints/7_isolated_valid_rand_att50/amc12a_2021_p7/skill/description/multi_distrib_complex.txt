This skill is a generalization of the distributive property of multiplication over addition for complex numbers. It can be used in any context where the distributive property of multiplication over addition for complex numbers is needed. To use this skill, you need to provide four complex numbers a, b, c, and d. The skill will then prove that the product of the sum of a and b and the sum of c and d is equal to the sum of the products of each pair of complex numbers.
