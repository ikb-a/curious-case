Since \\( n \\) is a positive integer, both \\( n-1 \\) and \\( n-2 \\) are non-negative integers. \n\nStep 3: Note that one of the factors \\( n-1 \\) or \\( n-2 \\) is always even, and the other is odd. This means their product \\( (n-2)(n-1) \\) is even.\n\nStep 4: The only even prime number is \\( 2 \\). Therefore, we need to find when \\( (n-2)(n-1) = 2 \\).\n\nStep 5: Set up the equation \\( (n-2)(n-1) = 2 \\) and solve for \\( n \\):\n- Case 1: \\( n-2 = 1 \\) and \\( n-1 = 2 \\) gives \\( n = 3 \\).\n- Case 2: \\( n-2 = 2 \\) and \\( n-1 = 1 \\) gives \\( n = 0 \\) (not a positive integer).\n\nStep 6: Since the only solution for positive integers is \\( n = 3 \\), conclude that there is exactly one positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( n^2 - 3n + 2 \\) is prime.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem amc12b_2002_p3:\n  fixes n ::nat\n  assumes \"n>0\"\n    and prime:\"prime (n^2+2-3*n)\"\n  shows \"n=3\"\n```\n\n## Proof"}}
