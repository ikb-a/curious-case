We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer.

What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: We start with the congruences given in the problem: \\( N \\equiv 5 \\mod 8 \\) and \\( N \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\).\n\nStep 2: From the first congruence, we can express \\( N \\) in the form \\( N = 8k + 5 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nStep 3: Substitute \\( N \\) into the second congruence: \n\\[\n8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6.\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6.\n\\]\nSubtracting 5 from both sides gives:\n\\[\n2k \\equiv -2 \\mod 6 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 2k \\equiv 4 \\mod 6.\n\\]\nDividing by 2 (noting that 2 and 6 are coprime) gives:\n\\[\nk \\equiv 2 \\mod 3.\n\\]\n\nStep 4: We can express \\( k \\) in terms of another integer \\( m \\):\n\\[\nk = 3m + 2.\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Substitute back into the expression for \\( N \\):\n\\[\nN = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21.\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Now we need to find values of \\( N \\) such that \\( N < 50 \\):\n\\[\n24m + 21 < 50 \\implies 24m < 29 \\implies m < \\frac{29}{24} \\implies m = 0.\n\\]\nThus, for \\( m = 0 \\):\n\\[\nN = 21.\n\\]\n\nStep 7: Check the next integer \\( m = 1 \\):\n\\[\nN = 24(1) + 21 = 45.\n\\]\nThis is also less than 50.\n\nStep 8: For \\( m = 2 \\):\n\\[\nN = 24(2) + 21 = 69,\n\\]\nwhich exceeds 50.\n\nStep 9: The valid values of \\( N \\) are 21 and 45. Their sum is:\n\\[\n21 + 45 = 66.\n\\]\n\nStep 10: Conclude that the sum of all possible values of \\( N \\) is 66.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n```\n\n## Proof", "action_agent_ai0": "```isabelle\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_149\n  imports Complex_Main\nbegin\n\n(* formal statement copy from the input *)\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\nproof -\n  (* Step 1: We start with the congruences given in the problem: \\( N \\equiv 5 \\mod 8 \\) and \\( N \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\). *)\n  let ?N = \"0\" (* Placeholder for values that satisfy conditions *)\n\n  (* Step 2: From the first congruence, we can express \\( N \\) in the form \\( N = 8k + 5 \\) for some integer \\( k \\). *)\n  have \"x mod 8 = 5 \\<Longrightarrow> x = 8k + 5\" for k :: nat\n    by (metis mod_eq_iff)\n\n  (* Step 3: Substitute \\( N \\) into the second congruence: \\( 8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\). *)\n  (* This simplifies to: \\( 2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\). *)\n  have \"2 * (k mod 3) + 5 mod 6 = 3\"\n    by (metis mod_add)\n\n  (* Step 4: This leads us to \\( 2k \\equiv 4 \\mod 6 \\). *)\n  (* Dividing by 2 gives: \\( k \\equiv 2 \\mod 3 \\). *)\n  have \"k mod 3 = 2\" for k :: nat\n    by (metis mod_eq_iff)\n\n  (* Step 5: We can express \\( k \\) in terms of another integer \\( m \\): \\( k = 3m + 2 \\). *)\n  have \"k = 3 * m + 2\"\n    for m :: nat\n    by (metis)\n\n  (* Step 6: Substitute back into the expression for \\( N \\): \\( N = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 21 \\). *)\n  have \"N = 24 * m + 21\"\n    for m :: nat\n    by (simp add: algebra_simps)\n\n  (* Step 7: Now we need to find values of \\( N \\) such that \\( N < 50 \\): \\( 24m + 21 < 50 \\). *)\n  have \"24m + 21 < 50 \\<Longrightarrow> m < 29/24\"\n    by (metis (no_types, lifting) add_less_mono)\n\n  (* Step 8: Thus, for \\( m = 0 \\): \\( N = 21 \\). *)\n  have \"N = 21\" if \"m = 0\" for m :: nat\n    by (metis)\n\n  (* Step 9: Check the next integer \\( m = 1 \\): \\( N = 24(1) + 21 = 45 \\). *)\n  have \"N = 45\" if \"m = 1\" for m :: nat\n    by (metis)\n\n  (* Step 10: For \\( m = 2 \\): \\( N = 24(2) + 21 = 69 \\), which exceeds 50. *)\n  have \"N > 50\" if \"m = 2\" for m :: nat\n    by (metis)\n\n  (* Step 11: The valid values of \\( N \\) are 21 and 45.
