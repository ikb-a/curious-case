Substituting into one of the given equations, we have $x+xy=5$ $x(1+y)=5$ $\\frac{1}{x}=\\frac{1+y}{5}.$ we can substitute back into $y+\\frac{1}{x}=29$ to obtain $y+\\frac{1+y}{5}=29$ $5y+1+y=145$ $y=24.$ We can then substitute once again to get $x=\\frac15$ $z=\\frac{5}{24}.$ Thus, $z+\\frac1y=\\frac{5}{24}+\\frac{1}{24}=\\frac{1}{4}$, so $m+n=005$.\n\n## Formal statement\ntheorem\n  fixes x y z :: real\n    and p :: rat\n  assumes \"0 < x \\<and> 0 < y \\<and> 0 < z\"\n    and \"x * y * z = 1\"\n    and \"x + 1 / z = 5\"\n    and \"y + 1 / x = 29\"\n    and \"z + 1 / y = p\"\n    and \"0 < p\" \n  shows \"let (m,n) = quotient_of p in m + n = 5\"\n\n## Structured informal proof\nStep 1: Rewrite the equation $xyz = 1$ as $\\frac{1}{z} = xy$.\nStep 2: Substitute the value of $\\frac{1}{z}$ into the equation $x + \\frac{1}{z} = 5$, resulting in $x + xy = 5$ then $x(1 + y) = 5$.\nStep 3: Solve for $\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{1 + y}{5}$.\nStep 4: Substitute the value of $\\frac{1}{x}$ into the equation $y + \\frac{1}{x} = 29$, leading to $y + \\frac{1+y}{5} = 29$.\nStep 5: Solve for $y$, getting $y = 24$.\nStep 6: Substitute the value of $y$ back into the equations to find $x = \\frac{1}{5}$ and $z = \\frac{5}{24}$.\nStep 7: Find $z + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{5}{24} + \\frac{1}{24} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nStep 8: The rational $p = \\frac{1}{4}$ can be expressed as $p = \\frac{m}{n}$ where $m = 1$ and $n = 4$.

Since \\( n \\) is a positive integer, both \\( n-1 \\) and \\( n-2 \\) are non-negative integers. *)\n  then have pos_factors: \"n - 1 > 0 \\<and> n - 2 \\ge> 0\"\n    using assms by auto\n\n  (* Step 3: Note that one of the factors \\( n-1 \\) or \\( n-2 \\) is odd and the other is even. The product of an even number and an odd number is even. *)\n  have even_odd: \"(n - 1) mod 2 + (n - 2) mod 2 = 1\"\n    by (metis pos_factors nat_mod_2_eq_0_iff_even)\n\n  (* Step 4: The only even prime number is \\( 2 \\). Therefore, we need to find when \\( (n-2)(n-1) = 2 \\). *)\n  have \"prime ((n - 2) * (n - 1)) \\<longleftrightarrow> ((n - 2) * (n - 1) = 2)\"\n    using prime by (metis even_odd)\n\n  (* Step 5: Set up the equations: *)\n  (* Case 1: \\( n-2 = 1 \\) and \\( n-1 = 2 \\) leads to \\( n = 3 \\). *)\n  have case1: \"n - 2 = 1 \\<and> n - 1 = 2 \\<Longrightarrow> n = 3\"\n    by auto\n\n  (* Case 2: \\( n-2 = 2 \\) and \\( n-1 = 1 \\) leads to \\( n = 0 \\) (not a positive integer). *)\n  have case2: \"n - 2 = 2 \\<and> n - 1 = 1 \\<Longrightarrow> n = 0\"\n    by auto\n\n  (* Step 6: Since the only solution for \\( n \\) that is a positive integer is \\( n = 3 \\), conclude that there is exactly one positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( n^2 - 3n + 2 \\) is prime. *)\n  show ?thesis\n  proof (cases \"n - 2 = 1\")\n    case True\n    then show ?thesis using case1 by auto\n  next\n    case False\n    hence \"n - 2 > 1\" by auto\n    then have \"n - 2 = 2\" using even_odd by auto\n    thus ?thesis using case2 by auto\n  qed\nqed\n```"}}
