Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$.

Then, we can express the sum as:\n\\[\nx \\cdot n + (73 - x) \\cdot (n + 1) = 546\n\\]\nwhere \\( x \\) is the number of terms equal to \\( n + 1 \\).\n\nStep 4: Simplifying the equation gives:\n\\[\nx \\cdot n + 73 - x + x = 546 \\implies 73 + x \\cdot n = 546 \\implies x \\cdot n = 473 \\implies x = \\frac{473}{n}\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Since \\( x \\) must be an integer, \\( n \\) must be a divisor of 473. The divisors of 473 are 1, 11, 43, and 473. However, since \\( x \\) must also be less than or equal to 73, we can only consider \\( n = 11 \\) or \\( n = 43 \\).\n\nStep 6: If \\( n = 11 \\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{473}{11} \\approx 43 \\quad (\\text{valid since } 43 \\leq 73)\n\\]\nIf \\( n = 43 \\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{473}{43} \\approx 11 \\quad (\\text{valid since } 11 \\leq 73)\n\\]\n\nStep 7: Determine the values of \\( r \\) for both cases:\n- For \\( n = 11 \\): \\( 43 \\) terms are \\( 12 \\) and \\( 30 \\) terms are \\( 11 \\).

(For real $x^{}_{}$, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the [[floor function|greatest integer]] less than or equal to $x^{}_{}$.) Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the summation. The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us a total of \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that the floor function can only yield integer values, and since the terms \\( \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\right\\rfloor \\) can differ by at most 1, the possible values for these terms are either \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( n = \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\). Then, we can express the sum as:\n\\[\nx \\cdot n + (73 - x) \\cdot (n + 1) = 546\n\\]\nwhere \\( x \\) is the number of terms equal to \\( n + 1 \\).\n\nStep 4: Simplifying the equation gives:\n\\[\nx \\cdot n + 73 - x + x = 546 \\implies 73 + x \\cdot n = 546 \\implies x \\cdot n = 473 \\implies x = \\frac{473}{n}\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Since \\( x \\) must be an integer, \\( n \\) must be a divisor of 473. The divisors of 473 are 1, 11, 43, and 473. However, since \\( x \\) must also be less than or equal to 73, we can only consider \\( n = 11 \\) or \\( n = 43 \\).\n\nStep 6: If \\( n = 11 \\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{473}{11} \\approx 43 \\quad (\\text{valid since } 43 \\leq 73)\n\\]\nIf \\( n = 43 \\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{473}{43} \\approx 11 \\quad (\\text{valid since } 11 \\leq 73)\n\\]\n\nStep 7: Determine the values of \\( r \\) for both cases:\n- For \\( n = 11 \\): \\( 43 \\) terms are \\( 12 \\) and \\( 30 \\) terms are \\( 11 \\). The first term \\( \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\right\\rfloor = 12 \\) implies \\( 12 \\leq r + 0.57 < 13 \\) leading to \\( 11.43 \\leq r < 12.43 \\).\n- For \\( n = 43 \\): \\( 11 \\) terms are \\( 44 \\) and \\( 62 \\) terms are \\( 43 \\). The first term \\( \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\right\\rfloor = 44 \\) implies \\( 44 \\leq r + 0.57 < 45 \\) leading to \\( 43.43 \\leq r < 44.43 \\).\n\nStep 8: Calculate \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor \\):\n- For \\( n = 11 \\): \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor \\) can be \\( 1143 \\) to \\( 1243 \\).\n- For \\( n = 43 \\): \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor \\) can be \\( 4343 \\) to \\( 4443 \\).\n\nStep 9: Since \\( r \\) must be consistent with the sum being 546, we find that \\( n = 11 \\) is the only valid case. Thus, \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
