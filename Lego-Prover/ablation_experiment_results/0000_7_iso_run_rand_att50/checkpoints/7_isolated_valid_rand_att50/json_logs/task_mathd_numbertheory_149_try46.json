It suffices to show $\\sqrt{2} \\leq x + \\frac{1}{2x}$. Let $y = \\sqrt{2}$. $y*y = 2$. Then $2x*x + 1 - 2x * \\sqrt{2} = y*y * x*x + 1 - 2xy = (xy - 1)^2 \\geq 0$. Also notice that $2x*x + 1 - 2x * \\sqrt{2} = 2x * (x + \\frac{1}{2x} - \\sqrt{2})$. Therefore $x + \\frac{1}{2x} - \\sqrt{2} \\geq 0$, given $2x > 0$.

We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer.

$y,$ and $z$ are three positive numbers that satisfy the equations $xyz = 1,$ $x + \\frac {1}{z} = 5,$ and $y + \\frac {1}{x} = 29.$ Then $z + \\frac {1}{y} = \\frac {m}{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are [[relatively prime]] positive integers. Find $m + n$. Show that it is 5. note: this is the type of problem that makes you think symmetry, but actually can be solved easily with substitution, and other normal technniques\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Rewrite the equation $xyz = 1$ as $\\frac{1}{z} = xy$.\nStep 2: Substitute the value of $\\frac{1}{z}$ into the equation $x + \\frac{1}{z} = 5$, resulting in $x + xy = 5$, then $x(1 + y) = 5$, then $\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{1 + y}{5}$.\nStep 3: Substitute the value of $\\frac{1}{x}$ into the equation $y + \\frac{1}{x} = 29$, leading to $y + \\frac{1+y}{5} = 29$. Solve for $y$, getting $y = 24$.\nStep 6: Substitute the value of $y$ back into the equations to find $x = \\frac{1}{5}$ and $z = \\frac{5}{24}$.\nStep 7: Find $z + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{5}{24} + \\frac{1}{24} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nStep 8: The rational $p = \\frac{1}{4}$ can be expressed as $p = \\frac{m}{n}$ where $m = 1$ and $n = 4$.
