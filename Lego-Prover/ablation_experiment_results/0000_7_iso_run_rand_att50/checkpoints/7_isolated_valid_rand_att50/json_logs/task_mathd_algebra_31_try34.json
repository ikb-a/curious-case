Let $b = a mod 3$. We know that b can only be 0, 1, or 2. Also, $a^2 mod 3 = b^2 mod 3$. If $b=0$, $a^2 mod 3 = 0^2 mod 3 = 0$; If $b=1$, $a^2 mod 3 = 1^2 mod 3 = 1$; If $b=2$, $a^2 mod 3 = 2^2 mod 3 = 1$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem\n  fixes a :: int\n  shows \"a^2 mod 3 = 0 \\<or> a^2 mod 3 = 1\"\n```\n\n## Structured informal proof\nStep 1: Introduce a new variable $b$ such that $b = a \\mod 3$.
