What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nWe are given that $N\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $N\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$.  We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer. Thus the 2 solutions less than $50$ are 21 and $21+24(1) = 45$, and their sum is $21+45=66$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n```\n", "ai0": "## Structured informal proof\n\nStep 1: We start with the congruences given in the problem: \\( N \\equiv 5 \\mod 8 \\) and \\( N \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\).\n\nStep 2: From the first congruence, we can express \\( N \\) in the form:\n\\[\nN = 8k + 5\n\\]\nfor some integer \\( k \\).\n\nStep 3: Substituting this expression into the second congruence, we have:\n\\[\n8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6\n\\]\nor equivalently:\n\\[\n2k \\equiv -2 \\mod 6 \\quad \\text{(which is the same as)} \\quad 2k \\equiv 4 \\mod 6\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Dividing through by 2 (noting that 2 and 6 are coprime), we get:\n\\[\nk \\equiv 2 \\mod 3\n\\]\nThis means we can express \\( k \\) as:\n\\[\nk = 3m + 2\n\\]\nfor some integer \\( m \\).\n\nStep 5: Substituting back into our expression for \\( N \\):\n\\[\nN = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Now we need to find values of \\( N \\) that are less than 50:\n\\[\n24m + 21 < 50\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n24m < 29 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad m < \\frac{29}{24} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad m \\leq 1\n\\]\n\nStep 7: The possible values for \\( m \\) are \\( 0 \\) and \\( 1 \\):\n- For \\( m = 0 \\): \\( N = 24(0) + 21 = 21 \\)\n- For \\( m = 1 \\): \\( N = 24(1) + 21 = 45 \\)\n\nStep 8: The valid values of \\( N \\) are \\( 21 \\) and \\( 45 \\). \n\nStep 9: Finally, we compute the sum of all possible values of \\( N \\):\n\\[\n21 + 45 = 66\n\\]\n\nThus, we have shown that the sum of all possible values of \\( N \\) is \\( 66 \\).\n\n## Request skills\n\n### Code 1\n```isabelle\nlemma congruence_mod:\n  fixes a b m :: nat\n  assumes \"a mod m = b mod m\"\n  shows \"a \u2261 b mod m\"\n```\n\n### Code 2\n```isabelle\nlemma linear_combination:\n  fixes a b c d :: nat\n  assumes \"a \u2261 b mod c\" and \"a \u2261 d mod e\"\n  shows \"a \u2261 b mod (lcm c e)\"\n```\n\n### Code 3\n```isabelle\nlemma find_values_under_limit:\n  fixes N :: nat\n  assumes \"N < L\" and \"N = a + b * k\" for some k\n  shows \"N = a + b * m\" for m in the range of k under the limit\n```\n\n### Code 4\n```isabelle\nlemma sum_of_congruent_numbers:\n  fixes S :: \"nat set\"\n  assumes \"finite S\" and \"x \u2208 S\" and \"y \u2208 S\"\n  shows \"sum S = x + y + ...

If their teacher puts them in groups of 8, the last group has 5 students. If their teacher instead puts them in groups of 6, the last group has 3 students. What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: We start with the congruences given in the problem: \\( N \\equiv 5 \\mod 8 \\) and \\( N \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\).\n\nStep 2: From the first congruence, we can express \\( N \\) in the form:\n\\[\nN = 8k + 5\n\\]\nfor some integer \\( k \\).\n\nStep 3: Substituting this expression into the second congruence, we have:\n\\[\n8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6\n\\]\nor equivalently:\n\\[\n2k \\equiv -2 \\mod 6 \\quad \\text{(which is the same as)} \\quad 2k \\equiv 4 \\mod 6\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Dividing through by 2 (noting that 2 and 6 are coprime), we get:\n\\[\nk \\equiv 2 \\mod 3\n\\]\nThis means we can express \\( k \\) as:\n\\[\nk = 3m + 2\n\\]\nfor some integer \\( m \\).\n\nStep 5: Substituting back into our expression for \\( N \\):\n\\[\nN = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Now we need to find values of \\( N \\) that are less than 50:\n\\[\n24m + 21 < 50\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n24m < 29 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad m < \\frac{29}{24} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad m \\leq 1\n\\]\n\nStep 7: The possible values for \\( m \\) are \\( 0 \\) and \\( 1 \\):\n- For \\( m = 0 \\): \\( N = 24(0) + 21 = 21 \\)\n- For \\( m = 1 \\): \\( N = 24(1) + 21 = 45 \\)\n\nStep 8: The valid values of \\( N \\) are \\( 21 \\) and \\( 45 \\). \n\nStep 9: Finally, we compute the sum of all possible values of \\( N \\):\n\\[\n21 + 45 = 66\n\\]\n\nThus, we have shown that the sum of all possible values of \\( N \\) is \\( 66 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n```\n\n## Proof", "action_agent_ai0": "```isabelle\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_149\n  imports Complex_Main\nbegin\n\n(* Here i will copy the formal statement from the input directly*)\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\nproof -\n  (* Step 1: Set up the range for N based on the constraints provided in the problem statement. *)\n  let ?S = \"{x :: nat. x < 50 \\<and> x mod 8 = 5 \\<and> x mod 6 = 3}\"\n\n  (* Step 2: Analyze the first congruence N \u2261 5 (mod 8). *)\n  have \"N = 8k + 5\" for k :: nat\n    by (metis mod_eq_0_iff_dvd) \n\n  (* Step 3: Substitute this expression into the second congruence N \u2261 3 (mod 6). *)\n  have \"8k + 5 \u2261 3 (mod 6)\"\n    by (metis mod_eq_0_iff_dvd)\n\n  (* Step 4: Simplify the equation. *)\n  have \"2k + 5 \u2261 3 (mod 6)\" \n    by (simp add: algebra_simps)\n\n  (* Step 5: Further simplify to find k. *)\n  have \"2k \u2261 -2 (mod 6)\" \n    by (simp add: field_simps)\n\n  (* Step 6: Convert to a simpler form. *)\n  have \"2k \u2261 4 (mod 6)\" \n    by (metis add_diff_eq)\n\n  (* Step 7: Divide through by 2, keeping in mind the coprimeness. *)\n  have \"k \u2261 2 (mod 3)\" \n    by (meson coprime_eq_1)\n\n  (* Step 8: Express k in terms of another variable, m. *)\n  have \"k = 3m + 2\" for m :: nat \n    by auto\n\n  (* Step 9: Substitute back into the expression for N. *)\n  have \"N = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 21\"\n    by (simp add: algebra_simps)\n\n  (* Step 10: Find valid m such that N < 50. *)\n  have \"24m + 21 < 50\" \n    by auto\n\n  (* Step 11: Solve the inequality for m. *)\n  have \"24m < 29\" \n    by simp\n  then have \"m < 29/24\" \n    by simp\n  thus \"m \u2264 1\" \n    by simp\n\n  (* Step 12: Calculate possible values for m. *)\n  (* m = 0 gives N = 21 *)\n  have \"N = 21\" if \"m = 0\" \n    by (metis that)\n\n  (* m = 1 gives N = 45 *)\n  have \"N = 45\" if \"m = 1\" \n    by (metis that)\n\n  (* Step 13: Collect all possible values of N. *)\n  have \"21 \u2208 ?S\" \n    by auto\n  have \"45 \u2208 ?S\" \n    by auto\n\n  (* Step 14: Calculate the sum of the valid values of N. *)\n  show ?thesis \n    by (simp add: 21 + 45)\nqed\n\nend\n```"}}
