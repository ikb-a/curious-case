Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$.

Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the summation, which is from \\(k = 19\\) to \\(k = 91\\). This gives us a total of \\(91 - 19 + 1 = 73\\) terms in the sum.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that each term \\(\\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor\\) can take on either the value \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1\\), depending on the fractional part of \\(r\\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\(n = \\lfloor r \\rfloor\\). Then, we can express the sum as:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of terms equal to } n \\cdot n + \\text{Number of terms equal to } n + 1 \\cdot (n + 1) = 546.\n\\]\nLet \\(x\\) be the number of terms equal to \\(n\\) and \\(y\\) be the number of terms equal to \\(n + 1\\). We have:\n\\[\nx + y = 73 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad nx + (n + 1)y = 546.\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Substitute \\(y = 73 - x\\) into the second equation:\n\\[\nnx + (n + 1)(73 - x) = 546.\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\nnx + 73n + 73 - nx - x = 546 \\implies 73n + 73 - x = 546 \\implies x = 73n + 73 - 546.\n\\]\nThus, we have:\n\\[\nx = 73n - 473.\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Since \\(x\\) must be non-negative, we find:\n\\[\n73n - 473 \\geq 0 \\implies n \\geq \\frac{473}{73} \\approx 6.5 \\implies n \\geq 7.\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Now, substituting \\(n = 7\\) into the equation for \\(x\\):\n\\[\nx = 73 \\cdot 7 - 473 = 511 - 473 = 38.\n\\]\nThus, \\(y = 73 - 38 = 35\\).\n\nStep 7: This means there are 38 terms equal to 7 and 35 terms equal to 8. The first term that equals 8 occurs when \\(k = 57\\):\n\\[\n\\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\implies 8 \\leq r + 0.57 < 8.01.\n\\]\n\nStep 8: Solving the inequalities gives:\n\\[\n7.43 \\leq r < 7.44.\n\\]\nMultiplying by 100 yields:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744.\n\\]\n\nStep 9: Therefore, we conclude that \\(\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743\\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

This gives us a total of \\(91 - 19 + 1 = 73\\) terms in the sum.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that each term \\(\\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor\\) can take on either the value \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1\\), depending on the fractional part of \\(r\\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\(n = \\lfloor r \\rfloor\\). Then, we can express the sum as:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of terms equal to } n \\cdot n + \\text{Number of terms equal to } n + 1 \\cdot (n + 1) = 546.\n\\]\nLet \\(x\\) be the number of terms equal to \\(n\\) and \\(y\\) be the number of terms equal to \\(n + 1\\). We have:\n\\[\nx + y = 73 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad nx + (n + 1)y = 546.\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Substitute \\(y = 73 - x\\) into the second equation:\n\\[\nnx + (n + 1)(73 - x) = 546.\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\nnx + 73n + 73 - nx - x = 546 \\implies 73n + 73 - x = 546 \\implies x = 73n + 73 - 546.\n\\]\nThus, we have:\n\\[\nx = 73n - 473.\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Since \\(x\\) must be non-negative, we find:\n\\[\n73n - 473 \\geq 0 \\implies n \\geq \\frac{473}{73} \\approx 6.5 \\implies n \\geq 7.\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Now, substituting \\(n = 7\\) into the equation for \\(x\\):\n\\[\nx = 73 \\cdot 7 - 473 = 511 - 473 = 38.\n\\]\nThus, \\(y = 73 - 38 = 35\\).\n\nStep 7: This means there are 38 terms equal to 7 and 35 terms equal to 8.
