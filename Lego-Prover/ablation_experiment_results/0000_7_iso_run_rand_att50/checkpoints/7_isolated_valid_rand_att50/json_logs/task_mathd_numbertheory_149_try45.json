Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer.

What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: We start with the congruences given in the problem: \\(N \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8}\\) and \\(N \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6}\\).\n\nStep 2: From the first congruence, we can express \\(N\\) in the form:\n\\[\nN = 8k + 5\n\\]\nfor some integer \\(k\\).\n\nStep 3: Substitute this expression into the second congruence:\n\\[\n8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6}\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6}\n\\]\nwhich further simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k \\equiv -2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{6}\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Dividing both sides by 2 (noting that 2 has an inverse modulo 6), we get:\n\\[\nk \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}\n\\]\nThis means:\n\\[\nk = 3m + 2\n\\]\nfor some integer \\(m\\).\n\nStep 5: Substitute back into the expression for \\(N\\):\n\\[\nN = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Now we need to find values of \\(N\\) that are less than 50:\n\\[\n24m + 21 < 50\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n24m < 29 \\implies m < \\frac{29}{24} \\implies m \\leq 1\n\\]\n\nStep 7: The possible values for \\(m\\) are \\(0\\) and \\(1\\):\n- For \\(m = 0\\): \\(N = 21\\)\n- For \\(m = 1\\): \\(N = 45\\)\n\nStep 8: The valid values of \\(N\\) are \\(21\\) and \\(45\\). Their sum is:\n\\[\n21 + 45 = 66\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n```\n\n## Proof", "action_agent_ai0": "```isabelle\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_149\n  imports Complex_Main\nbegin\n\n(* Step 1: We start with the congruences given in the problem: N \u2261 5 (mod 8) and N \u2261 3 (mod 6). *)\nlemma congruences:\n  fixes N :: nat\n  assumes \"N mod 8 = 5\" \"N mod 6 = 3\"\n  shows \"N < 50\"\nproof -\n  (* Step 2: From the first congruence, we can express N in the form: N = 8k + 5 for some integer k. *)\n  obtain k where \"N = 8 * k + 5\" using assms(1) by auto\n\n  (* Step 3: Substitute this expression into the second congruence: 8k + 5 \u2261 3 (mod 6). *)\n  have \"8 * k + 5 mod 6 = 3\" by (simp add: assms(2) mod_add_eq)\n  \n  (* This simplifies to: 2k + 5 \u2261 3 (mod 6). *)\n  have \"2 * k + 5 mod 6 = 3\" \n    by (metis (no_types, lifting) mod_add_eq mod_mult_eq)\n\n  (* Step 4: Further simplifies to: 2k \u2261 -2 \u2261 4 (mod 6). *)\n  have \"2 * k mod 6 = 4\" \n    by (metis (no_types, lifting) mod_add_eq)\n\n  (* Step 5: Dividing both sides by 2 gives k \u2261 2 (mod 3). *)\n  have \"k mod 3 = 2\" \n    by (metis (no_types, lifting) mod_add_eq)\n\n  (* This means: k = 3m + 2 for some integer m. *)\n  obtain m where \"k = 3 * m + 2\" by (metis)\n\n  (* Step 6: Substitute back into the expression for N: N = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 21. *)\n  have \"N = 8 * (3 * m + 2) + 5 = 24 * m + 16 + 5 = 24 * m + 21\"\n    by (metis)\n\n  (* Step 7: We need to find values of N that are less than 50: 24m + 21 < 50. *)\n  have \"24 * m + 21 < 50\" \n    shows \"m < 29/24\" \n    by (simp add: less_le)\n\n  (* This implies m \u2264 1. *)\n  have \"m \u2264 1\" by (simp add: le_less_trans)\n\n  (* Step 8: The possible values for m are 0 and 1. *)\n  have \"N = 21\" if \"m = 0\" by (subst that) auto\n  have \"N = 45\" if \"m = 1\" by (subst that) auto\n\n  (* Valid values of N are 21 and 45. *)\n  show ?thesis \n    by (simp add: that)\nqed\n\n(* formal statement copy from the input *)\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\nproof -\n  (* We find the valid values of N and sum them up. *)\n  have \"N = {21, 45}\" \n    by (metis (no_types, lifting) congruences)\n  then show ?thesis \n    by (simp add: sum.insert)\nqed\n\nend\n```"}}
