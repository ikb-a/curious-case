Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$. Solving shows that $\\frac{743}{100} \\le r < \\frac{744}{100}$, so $743\\le 100r < 744$, and $\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us a total of \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that the values of \\( \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\right\\rfloor \\) can only differ by at most 1 for consecutive \\( k \\) values.

Since the total sum is 546 and there are 73 terms, the average value of the terms is \\( \\frac{546}{73} = 7.48 \\). This indicates that most of the terms are likely to be either 7 or 8.\n\nStep 4: Determine the distribution of the values. Let \\( x \\) be the number of terms equal to 8, and \\( 73 - x \\) be the number of terms equal to 7.

Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the summation. The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us a total of \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that the values of \\( \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\right\\rfloor \\) can only differ by at most 1 for consecutive \\( k \\) values. This means that the terms can either be \\( \\lfloor r + 0.19 \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r + 0.20 \\rfloor \\), and so on, up to \\( \\lfloor r + 0.91 \\rfloor \\).\n\nStep 3: Calculate the average of the sum. Since the total sum is 546 and there are 73 terms, the average value of the terms is \\( \\frac{546}{73} = 7.48 \\). This indicates that most of the terms are likely to be either 7 or 8.\n\nStep 4: Determine the distribution of the values. Let \\( x \\) be the number of terms equal to 8, and \\( 73 - x \\) be the number of terms equal to 7. The equation can be set up as:\n\\[\n8x + 7(73 - x) = 546\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n8x + 511 - 7x = 546 \\implies x = 35\n\\]\nThus, there are 35 terms equal to 8 and 38 terms equal to 7.\n\nStep 5: Establish bounds for \\( r \\). The first term that equals 8 occurs when \\( k = 57 \\):\n\\[\n\\lfloor r + 0.57 \\rfloor = 8 \\implies 8 \\leq r + 0.57 < 9 \\implies 7.43 \\leq r < 8.43\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Scale the bounds for \\( r \\) by 100 to find \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor \\):\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 843\n\\]\nThus, \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
