Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nThere are $91 - 19 + 1 = 73$ numbers in the [[sequence]]. Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$.

Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the summation, which is from \\( k = 19 \\) to \\( k = 91 \\). This gives us a total of \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms in the sum.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that each term in the sum, \\( \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\right\\rfloor \\), can take on either the value \\( \\lfloor r + 0.19 \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r + 0.91 \\rfloor \\), since the terms are spaced by \\( 0.01 \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( a = \\lfloor r + 0.19 \\rfloor \\) and \\( b = \\lfloor r + 0.91 \\rfloor \\). Since \\( b \\) can be at most \\( a + 1 \\), we have two possible values for the terms: \\( a \\) and \\( a + 1 \\).\n\nStep 4: Set up the equation based on the total sum:\n\\[\nx \\cdot a + (73 - x) \\cdot (a + 1) = 546\n\\]\nwhere \\( x \\) is the number of terms equal to \\( a + 1 \\).\n\nStep 5: Simplify the equation:\n\\[\nx \\cdot a + (73 - x) \\cdot (a + 1) = 546 \\implies x \\cdot a + 73a + 73 - x \\cdot a - x = 546 \\implies 73 + 73a - x = 546\n\\]\nThis leads to:\n\\[\nx = 73 + 73a - 546 \\implies x = 73a - 473\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Since \\( x \\) must be a non-negative integer, we derive:\n\\[\n73a - 473 \\geq 0 \\implies a \\geq \\frac{473}{73} \\approx 6.5 \\implies a \\geq 7\n\\]\n\nStep 7: Now, we can find the maximum possible value of \\( a \\). If \\( a = 7 \\):\n\\[\nx = 73 \\cdot 7 - 473 = 511 - 473 = 38\n\\]\nThis means \\( 38 \\) terms are \\( 8 \\) and \\( 35 \\) terms are \\( 7 \\).\n\nStep 8: The next step is to find the bounds for \\( r \\):\n- For \\( 8 \\): \\( 8 \\leq r + 0.91 < 8.01 \\) implies \\( 7.09 < r < 8.00 \\).\n- For \\( 7 \\): \\( 7 \\leq r + 0.19 < 7.01 \\) implies \\( 6.81 < r < 7.00 \\).\n\nStep 9: The overlapping range for \\( r \\) is \\( 7.09 < r < 7.00 \\), which is not possible. Thus, we check \\( a = 8 \\):\n\\[\nx = 73 \\cdot 8 - 473 = 584 - 473 = 111 \\text{ (not possible)}\n\\]\n\nStep 10: Therefore, we conclude that \\( a = 7 \\) is valid, and we can find \\( r \\):\n\\[\n7.09 < r < 7.91\n\\]\nThus, multiplying by \\( 100 \\):\n\\[\n709 < 100r < 791\n\\]\nThis gives \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

The base case is trivial. Inductive case: when n is 0 it is also trivial. When $n>0$, let $m=2^n$, and we have $3^m - 1 \\equiv 4*m \\pmod{8*m}$. Then there is $k$ where $3^m - 1 = (8*m)*k + 4*m$. Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$ Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$. Therefore the inductive case holds.

(For real $x^{}_{}$, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the [[floor function|greatest integer]] less than or equal to $x^{}_{}$.) Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the summation, which is from \\( k = 19 \\) to \\( k = 91 \\). This gives us a total of \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms in the sum.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that each term in the sum, \\( \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\right\\rfloor \\), can take on either the value \\( \\lfloor r + 0.19 \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r + 0.91 \\rfloor \\), since the terms are spaced by \\( 0.01 \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( a = \\lfloor r + 0.19 \\rfloor \\) and \\( b = \\lfloor r + 0.91 \\rfloor \\). Since \\( b \\) can be at most \\( a + 1 \\), we have two possible values for the terms: \\( a \\) and \\( a + 1 \\).\n\nStep 4: Set up the equation based on the total sum:\n\\[\nx \\cdot a + (73 - x) \\cdot (a + 1) = 546\n\\]\nwhere \\( x \\) is the number of terms equal to \\( a + 1 \\).\n\nStep 5: Simplify the equation:\n\\[\nx \\cdot a + (73 - x) \\cdot (a + 1) = 546 \\implies x \\cdot a + 73a + 73 - x \\cdot a - x = 546 \\implies 73 + 73a - x = 546\n\\]\nThis leads to:\n\\[\nx = 73 + 73a - 546 \\implies x = 73a - 473\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Since \\( x \\) must be a non-negative integer, we derive:\n\\[\n73a - 473 \\geq 0 \\implies a \\geq \\frac{473}{73} \\approx 6.5 \\implies a \\geq 7\n\\]\n\nStep 7: Now, we can find the maximum possible value of \\( a \\). If \\( a = 7 \\):\n\\[\nx = 73 \\cdot 7 - 473 = 511 - 473 = 38\n\\]\nThis means \\( 38 \\) terms are \\( 8 \\) and \\( 35 \\) terms are \\( 7 \\).\n\nStep 8: The next step is to find the bounds for \\( r \\):\n- For \\( 8 \\): \\( 8 \\leq r + 0.91 < 8.01 \\) implies \\( 7.09 < r < 8.00 \\).\n- For \\( 7 \\): \\( 7 \\leq r + 0.19 < 7.01 \\) implies \\( 6.81 < r < 7.00 \\).\n\nStep 9: The overlapping range for \\( r \\) is \\( 7.09 < r < 7.00 \\), which is not possible. Thus, we check \\( a = 8 \\):\n\\[\nx = 73 \\cdot 8 - 473 = 584 - 473 = 111 \\text{ (not possible)}\n\\]\n\nStep 10: Therefore, we conclude that \\( a = 7 \\) is valid, and we can find \\( r \\):\n\\[\n7.09 < r < 7.91\n\\]\nThus, multiplying by \\( 100 \\):\n\\[\n709 < 100r < 791\n\\]\nThis gives \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
