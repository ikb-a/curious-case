Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$.
