Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nThere are $91 - 19 + 1 = 73$ numbers in the [[sequence]]. Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$. Solving shows that $\\frac{743}{100} \\le r < \\frac{744}{100}$, so $743\\le 100r < 744$, and $\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us a total of \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that the floor function can yield either \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) as either \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\) depending on the value of \\( r \\).\n\nStep 3: Calculate the average of the sum. Since the total sum is 546 and there are 73 terms, we find the average:\n\\[\n\\frac{546}{73} = 7 \\text{ remainder } 35.\n\\]\nThis indicates that the terms can either be 7 or 8.\n\nStep 4: Determine the distribution of the values. Let \\( x \\) be the number of terms equal to 8. Then, the number of terms equal to 7 is \\( 73 - x \\). The equation for the sum becomes:\n\\[\n7(73 - x) + 8x = 546.\n\\]\nSimplifying this gives:\n\\[\n511 - 7x + 8x = 546 \\implies x = 35.\n\\]\nThus, there are 35 terms equal to 8 and \\( 73 - 35 = 38 \\) terms equal to 7.\n\nStep 5: Establish bounds for \\( r \\). The first term that equals 8 occurs when \\( k = 57 \\):\n\\[\n\\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\implies 8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 9.\n\\]\nThis leads to:\n\\[\n8 - \\frac{57}{100} \\leq r < 9 - \\frac{57}{100} \\implies \\frac{743}{100} \\leq r < \\frac{744}{100}.\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Multiply the bounds by 100 to find \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor \\):\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744.\n\\]\nThus, \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Request skills\n### Thoughts 1\nUnderstanding the properties of the floor function and how it interacts with real numbers is crucial for this proof.\n\n### Code 1\n```isabelle\nlemma floor_function_properties:\n  fixes r :: real\n  shows \"floor (r + k / 100) = floor r + (if r + k / 100 - floor r < 1 then 0 else 1)\"\n```\n\n### Thoughts 2\nA lemma to handle the summation of floor functions over a range would be beneficial.\n\n### Code 2\n```isabelle\nlemma sum_floor_range:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"a < b\"\n  shows \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in> {a..b}. floor (r + k / 100)) = (b - a + 1) * floor r + (\\<Sum> k \\<in> {a..b}.

The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us a total of \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that the floor function can yield either \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) as either \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\) depending on the value of \\( r \\).\n\nStep 3: Calculate the average of the sum. Since the total sum is 546 and there are 73 terms, we find the average:\n\\[\n\\frac{546}{73} = 7 \\text{ remainder } 35.\n\\]\nThis indicates that the terms can either be 7 or 8.\n\nStep 4: Determine the distribution of the values. Let \\( x \\) be the number of terms equal to 8. Then, the number of terms equal to 7 is \\( 73 - x \\). The equation for the sum becomes:\n\\[\n7(73 - x) + 8x = 546.\n\\]\nSimplifying this gives:\n\\[\n511 - 7x + 8x = 546 \\implies x = 35.\n\\]\nThus, there are 35 terms equal to 8 and \\( 73 - 35 = 38 \\) terms equal to 7.\n\nStep 5: Establish bounds for \\( r \\). The first term that equals 8 occurs when \\( k = 57 \\):\n\\[\n\\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\implies 8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 9.\n\\]\nThis leads to:\n\\[\n8 - \\frac{57}{100} \\leq r < 9 - \\frac{57}{100} \\implies \\frac{743}{100} \\leq r < \\frac{744}{100}.\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Multiply the bounds by 100 to find \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor \\):\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744.\n\\]\nThus, \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us a total of \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that the floor function can yield either \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) as either \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\) depending on the value of \\( r \\).\n\nStep 3: Calculate the average of the sum. Since the total sum is 546 and there are 73 terms, we find the average:\n\\[\n\\frac{546}{73} = 7 \\text{ remainder } 35.\n\\]\nThis indicates that the terms can either be 7 or 8.\n\nStep 4: Determine the distribution of the values. Let \\( x \\) be the number of terms equal to 8. Then, the number of terms equal to 7 is \\( 73 - x \\). The equation for the sum becomes:\n\\[\n7(73 - x) + 8x = 546.\n\\]\nSimplifying this gives:\n\\[\n511 - 7x + 8x = 546 \\implies x = 35.\n\\]\nThus, there are 35 terms equal to 8 and \\( 73 - 35 = 38 \\) terms equal to 7.\n\nStep 5: Establish bounds for \\( r \\). The first term that equals 8 occurs when \\( k = 57 \\):\n\\[\n\\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\implies 8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 9.\n\\]\nThis leads to:\n\\[\n8 - \\frac{57}{100} \\leq r < 9 - \\frac{57}{100} \\implies \\frac{743}{100} \\leq r < \\frac{744}{100}.\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Multiply the bounds by 100 to find \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor \\):\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744.\n\\]\nThus, \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
