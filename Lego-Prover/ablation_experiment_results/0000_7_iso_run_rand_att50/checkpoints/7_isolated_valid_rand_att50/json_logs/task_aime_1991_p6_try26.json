Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$. Solving shows that $\\frac{743}{100} \\le r < \\frac{744}{100}$, so $743\\le 100r < 744$, and $\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

The equation can be set up as:\n\\[\n7(73 - x) + 8x = 546\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n511 + x = 546 \\implies x = 35\n\\]\nThus, there are 35 terms equal to 8 and \\(73 - 35 = 38\\) terms equal to 7.\n\nStep 5: Identify the critical value of \\(r\\). The first term that equals 8 occurs at \\(k = 57\\):\n\\[\n\\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\implies 8 \\leq r + 0.57 < 9\n\\]\nThis leads to:\n\\[\n7.43 \\leq r < 8.43\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Scale the bounds for \\(r\\) to find \\(100r\\):\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 843\n\\]\nThus, the greatest integer less than or equal to \\(100r\\) is:\n\\[\n\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
