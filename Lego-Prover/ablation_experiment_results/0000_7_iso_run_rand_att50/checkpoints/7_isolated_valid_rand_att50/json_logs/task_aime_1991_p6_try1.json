Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$. Solving shows that $\\frac{743}{100} \\le r < \\frac{744}{100}$, so $743\\le 100r < 744$, and $\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the summation. The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us a total of \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that the values of \\( \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\right\\rfloor \\) can only differ by at most 1 for consecutive \\( k \\) values, since \\( \\frac{k}{100} \\) increments by \\( 0.01 \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( n = \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\). Then, we can express \\( r \\) as \\( n + f \\) where \\( 0 \\leq f < 1 \\). The terms can be rewritten as:\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor n + f + \\frac{k}{100} \\right\\rfloor = n + \\left\\lfloor f + \\frac{k}{100} \\right\\rfloor\n\\]\nThis means that for \\( k \\) such that \\( f + \\frac{k}{100} < 1 \\), the floor will yield \\( n \\), and for \\( k \\) such that \\( f + \\frac{k}{100} \\geq 1 \\), it will yield \\( n + 1 \\).\n\nStep 4: Determine the threshold \\( k_0 \\) where \\( f + \\frac{k_0}{100} = 1 \\). This gives us \\( k_0 = 100(1 - f) \\). The number of \\( k \\) values that yield \\( n + 1 \\) is \\( 91 - k_0 + 1 \\).\n\nStep 5: Set up the equation for the total sum:\n\\[\n\\text{Total} = (n)(73 - (91 - k_0 + 1)) + (n + 1)(91 - k_0 + 1) = 546\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\nn(73 - (91 - k_0 + 1)) + (n + 1)(91 - k_0 + 1) = 546\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Substitute \\( k_0 = 100(1 - f) \\) into the equation and solve for \\( n \\) and \\( f \\).\n\nStep 7: Since \\( \\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35 \\), we conclude that there are 35 terms equal to \\( n + 1 \\) (which must be 8) and 38 terms equal to \\( n \\) (which must be 7).\n\nStep 8: The first term that equals 8 occurs at \\( k = 57 \\), leading to the inequality:\n\\[\n8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01\n\\]\nThis implies:\n\\[\n\\frac{743}{100} \\leq r < \\frac{744}{100}\n\\]\n\nStep 9: Therefore, we conclude that:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744\n\\]\nThus, \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
