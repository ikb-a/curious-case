We can rewrite it as \\( (n-1)(n-2) \\).\n\nStep 2: Analyze the factors \\( n-1 \\) and \\( n-2 \\). Since \\( n \\) is a positive integer, both \\( n-1 \\) and \\( n-2 \\) are non-negative integers. \n\nStep 3: Note that one of the factors \\( n-1 \\) or \\( n-2 \\) is odd and the other is even. Therefore, their product \\( (n-1)(n-2) \\) is even.\n\nStep 4: The only even prime number is \\( 2 \\). Thus, we need to find when \\( (n-1)(n-2) = 2 \\).\n\nStep 5: Set up the equation \\( (n-1)(n-2) = 2 \\). The pairs of factors of \\( 2 \\) are \\( (1, 2) \\) and \\( (2, 1) \\).\n\nStep 6: Solve for \\( n \\):\n- For \\( n-1 = 1 \\) and \\( n-2 = 2 \\): \n  - This gives \\( n = 2 \\) and \\( n = 3 \\), which is not valid since \\( n-2 \\) must be \\( 0 \\) or positive.\n- For \\( n-1 = 2 \\) and \\( n-2 = 1 \\):\n  - This gives \\( n = 3 \\) and \\( n = 2 \\), which is valid.\n\nStep 7: Check if \\( n = 3 \\) yields a prime:\n- Substitute \\( n = 3 \\) into the original expression: \n  - \\( 3^2 - 3 \\cdot 3 + 2 = 2 \\), which is prime.\n\nStep 8: Check other positive integers \\( n \\):\n- For \\( n = 1 \\): \\( 1^2 - 3 \\cdot 1 + 2 = 0 \\) (not prime).\n- For \\( n = 2 \\): \\( 2^2 - 3 \\cdot 2 + 2 = 0 \\) (not prime).\n- For \\( n = 4 \\): \\( 4^2 - 3 \\cdot 4 + 2 = 2 \\) (prime).\n- For \\( n = 5 \\): \\( 5^2 - 3 \\cdot 5 + 2 = 2 \\) (prime).\n- For \\( n \\geq 6 \\): The product \\( (n-1)(n-2) \\) will yield numbers greater than \\( 2 \\) and thus cannot be prime.\n\nStep 9: Conclude that the only positive integer \\( n \\) for which \\( n^2 - 3n + 2 \\) is prime is \\( n = 3 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem amc12b_2002_p3:\n  fixes n ::nat\n  assumes \"n>0\"\n    and prime:\"prime (n^2+2-3*n)\"\n  shows \"n=3\"\n```\n\n## Proof"}}
