We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer.

If their teacher puts them in groups of 8, the last group has 5 students. If their teacher instead puts them in groups of 6, the last group has 3 students. What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Set up the congruences based on the problem statement. We have:\n- \\( N \\equiv 5 \\mod 8 \\) (since the last group of 8 has 5 students)\n- \\( N \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\) (since the last group of 6 has 3 students)\n\nStep 2: Express \\( N \\) in terms of the first congruence. From \\( N \\equiv 5 \\mod 8 \\), we can write:\n\\[ N = 8k + 5 \\]\nfor some integer \\( k \\).\n\nStep 3: Substitute \\( N \\) into the second congruence. We need to satisfy:\n\\[ 8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ 2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\]\nwhich further simplifies to:\n\\[ 2k \\equiv -2 \\mod 6 \\]\nor equivalently:\n\\[ 2k \\equiv 4 \\mod 6 \\]\n\nStep 4: Divide the entire equation by 2 (noting that 2 and 6 are coprime):\n\\[ k \\equiv 2 \\mod 3 \\]\nThis means:\n\\[ k = 3m + 2 \\]\nfor some integer \\( m \\).\n\nStep 5: Substitute back to find \\( N \\):\n\\[ N = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21 \\]\n\nStep 6: Determine the possible values of \\( N \\) under the constraint \\( N < 50 \\):\n- For \\( m = 0 \\): \\( N = 21 \\)\n- For \\( m = 1 \\): \\( N = 45 \\)\n- For \\( m = 2 \\): \\( N = 69 \\) (not valid since \\( N < 50 \\))\n\nStep 7: The valid values of \\( N \\) are 21 and 45. Their sum is:\n\\[ 21 + 45 = 66 \\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n```\n\n## Proof", "action_agent_ai0": "```isabelle\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_149\n  imports Complex_Main\nbegin\n\n(* Here I will copy the formal statement from the input directly *)\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\nproof -\n  (* Step 1: Set up the congruences based on the problem statement. *)\n  (* We need to find N such that N \u2261 5 (mod 8) and N \u2261 3 (mod 6). *)\n  \n  (* Define the set of valid N values based on the given conditions. *)\n  let ?S = \"{x::nat. x < 50 \\<and> x mod 8 = 5 \\<and> x mod 6 = 3}\"\n  \n  (* Step 2: Express N in terms of the first congruence. *)\n  (* We will check possible values for N under the constraints. *)\n  have \"x mod 8 = 5 \\<Longrightarrow> x = 8k + 5\" for k\n    by (metis mod_eq_0_iff_dvd)\n\n  (* Check for the possible values of k such that N < 50. *)\n  have \"x mod 6 = 3 \\<Longrightarrow> x = 6m + 3\" for m\n    by (metis mod_eq_0_iff_dvd)\n\n  (* We will find values of N that satisfy both conditions. *)\n  (* Step 3: Substitute N into the second congruence. *)\n  (* We need to satisfy: 8k + 5 \u2261 3 (mod 6). *)\n  (* Simplifying gives: 2k + 5 \u2261 3 (mod 6) -> 2k \u2261 -2 (mod 6) -> 2k \u2261 4 (mod 6) *)\n  \n  (* Step 4: Divide by 2 since 2 and 6 are coprime. *)\n  (* This leads to: k \u2261 2 (mod 3) *)\n  (* Therefore, k can be expressed as k = 3m + 2 for some integer m. *)\n\n  (* Step 5: Substitute back to find N. *)\n  have \"N = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21\"\n\n  (* Step 6: Determine the possible values of N under the constraint N < 50. *)\n  (* For m = 0: N = 21 *)\n  (* For m = 1: N = 45 *)\n  (* For m = 2: N = 69 (not valid since N < 50) *)\n  \n  (* Valid values are 21 and 45. *)\n  let ?valid_Ns = \"{21, 45}\"\n\n  (* Step 7: Calculate the sum of valid values. *)\n  have \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> ?valid_Ns. k) = 21 + 45\"\n    by auto\n\n  (* Show that the sum equals 66. *)\n  also have \"... = 66\" by simp\n  finally show ?thesis by simp\nqed\n\nend\n```"}}
