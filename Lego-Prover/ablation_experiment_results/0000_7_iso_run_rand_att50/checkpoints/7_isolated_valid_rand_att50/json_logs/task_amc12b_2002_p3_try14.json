We can rewrite it as \\( (n-1)(n-2) \\).\n\nStep 2: Analyze the factors \\( n-1 \\) and \\( n-2 \\). Since \\( n \\) is a positive integer, both \\( n-1 \\) and \\( n-2 \\) are non-negative integers. \n\nStep 3: Note that one of the factors \\( n-1 \\) or \\( n-2 \\) is odd and the other is even. The product of an odd and an even number is even.\n\nStep 4: The only even prime number is \\( 2 \\). Therefore, we need to find when \\( (n-1)(n-2) = 2 \\).\n\nStep 5: Set up the equation \\( (n-1)(n-2) = 2 \\) and solve for \\( n \\):\n- If \\( n-1 = 2 \\) and \\( n-2 = 1 \\), then \\( n = 3 \\).\n- If \\( n-1 = 1 \\) and \\( n-2 = 2 \\), this is not possible since \\( n-1 \\) cannot be less than \\( n-2 \\).\n\nStep 6: Conclude that the only positive integer \\( n \\) for which \\( n^2 - 3n + 2 \\) is prime is \\( n = 3 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem amc12b_2002_p3:\n  fixes n ::nat\n  assumes \"n>0\"\n    and prime:\"prime (n^2+2-3*n)\"\n  shows \"n=3\"\n```\n\n## Proof"}}
