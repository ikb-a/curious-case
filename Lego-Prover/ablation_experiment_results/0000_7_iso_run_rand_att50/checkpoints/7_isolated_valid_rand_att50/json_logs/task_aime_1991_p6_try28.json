Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$.

Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$ Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$.

Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Define the sequence of terms as \\( S = \\left\\{ \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\right\\rfloor \\mid k \\in \\{19, 20, \\ldots, 91\\} \\right\\} \\). The total number of terms in this sequence is \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\).\n\nStep 2: Recognize that since the floor function can only change by at most 1 for consecutive values of \\( k \\), all terms in the sequence can take on either \\( \\lfloor r + 0.19 \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r + 0.91 \\rfloor \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( a = \\lfloor r + 0.19 \\rfloor \\) and \\( b = \\lfloor r + 0.91 \\rfloor \\). Since \\( b \\) can be at most \\( a + 1 \\), we have two cases: either all terms are \\( a \\) or a mix of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\nStep 4: Given the sum \\( \\sum_{k=19}^{91} \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\right\\rfloor = 546 \\), we can express this as \\( x \\cdot a + (73 - x) \\cdot b = 546 \\), where \\( x \\) is the number of terms equal to \\( a \\).\n\nStep 5: Rearranging gives us \\( x \\cdot a + (73 - x) \\cdot (a + 1) = 546 \\). This simplifies to \\( 73a + 73 - x = 546 \\), leading to \\( 73a - x = 473 \\).\n\nStep 6: From this, we can express \\( x \\) as \\( x = 73a - 473 \\). Since \\( x \\) must be non-negative, we have \\( 73a \\geq 473 \\), which gives \\( a \\geq \\frac{473}{73} \\approx 6.5 \\). Thus, \\( a \\geq 7 \\).\n\nStep 7: Since \\( a \\) is an integer, the smallest possible value for \\( a \\) is 7. If \\( a = 7 \\), then \\( x = 73 \\cdot 7 - 473 = 14 \\). This means there are 14 terms equal to 7 and \\( 73 - 14 = 59 \\) terms equal to 8.\n\nStep 8: The first term that equals 8 occurs when \\( k = 39 \\), which gives \\( \\lfloor r + 0.57 \\rfloor = 8 \\). Thus, we have \\( 8 \\leq r + 0.57 < 8.01 \\), leading to \\( 7.43 \\leq r < 7.44 \\).\n\nStep 9: Multiplying through by 100 gives \\( 743 \\leq 100r < 744 \\), so \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
