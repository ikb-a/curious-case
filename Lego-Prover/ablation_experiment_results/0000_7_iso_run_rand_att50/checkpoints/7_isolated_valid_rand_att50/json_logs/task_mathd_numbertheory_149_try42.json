We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer. Thus the 2 solutions less than $50$ are 21 and $21+24(1) = 45$, and their sum is $21+45=66$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50

If their teacher puts them in groups of 8, the last group has 5 students. If their teacher instead puts them in groups of 6, the last group has 3 students. What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: We start with the congruences given in the problem: \\( N \\equiv 5 \\mod 8 \\) and \\( N \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\).\n\nStep 2: From the first congruence, we can express \\( N \\) in the form \\( N = 8k + 5 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nStep 3: Substitute this expression into the second congruence: \n\\[\n8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6.\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6.\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Rearranging gives:\n\\[\n2k \\equiv -2 \\mod 6 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 2k \\equiv 4 \\mod 6.\n\\]\nDividing through by 2 (noting that 2 and 6 are coprime), we have:\n\\[\nk \\equiv 2 \\mod 3.\n\\]\n\nStep 5: This means \\( k \\) can be expressed as \\( k = 3m + 2 \\) for some integer \\( m \\).\n\nStep 6: Substitute back into the expression for \\( N \\):\n\\[\nN = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21.\n\\]\n\nStep 7: We need \\( N < 50 \\), so we solve:\n\\[\n24m + 21 < 50 \\implies 24m < 29 \\implies m < \\frac{29}{24} \\implies m \\leq 1.\n\\]\n\nStep 8: The possible values for \\( m \\) are \\( 0 \\) and \\( 1 \\):\n- For \\( m = 0 \\): \\( N = 21 \\).\n- For \\( m = 1 \\): \\( N = 45 \\).\n\nStep 9: The valid values of \\( N \\) are \\( 21 \\) and \\( 45 \\). \n\nStep 10: Finally, we compute the sum of all possible values of \\( N \\):\n\\[\n21 + 45 = 66.\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n```\n\n## Proof", "action_agent_ai0": "```isabelle\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_149\n  imports Complex_Main\nbegin\n\n(* formal statement copy from the input *)\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\nproof -\n  (* Step 1: We start with the congruences given in the problem: \\( N \\equiv 5 \\mod 8 \\) and \\( N \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\). *)\n  let ?N = \"\u03bbx. x < 50 \u2227 x mod 8 = 5 \u2227 x mod 6 = 3\"\n  \n  (* Step 2: From the first congruence, we can express \\( N \\) in the form \\( N = 8k + 5 \\) for some integer \\( k \\). *)\n  have \"\u2203k. ?N (8*k + 5)\"\n  proof -\n    {\n      fix k :: nat\n      assume \"k < 50\"\n      hence \"8*k + 5 < 50 \u27f6 k < 5.625 \u27f6 k \u2264 5\" by auto\n    }\n    thus ?thesis by auto\n  qed\n\n  (* Step 3: Substitute this expression into the second congruence: \\( 8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\). *)\n  have \"8*k + 5 \u2261 3 (mod 6) \u27f7 2*k + 5 \u2261 3 (mod 6)\"\n    by (simp add: mod_mult)\n  \n  (* Step 4: Rearranging gives: \\( 2k \u2261 -2 \\mod 6 \\) or \\( 2k \u2261 4 \\mod 6 \\). *)\n  have \"2*k \u2261 4 (mod 6)\"\n    by (simp add: Suc_eq_plus1)\n\n  (* Step 5: This means \\( k \\) can be expressed as \\( k = 3m + 2 \\) for some integer \\( m \\). *)\n  have \"\u2203m. k = 3*m + 2\" by (metis)\n\n  (* Step 6: Substitute back into the expression for \\( N \\): \\( N = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 21 \\). *)\n  have \"N = 24*m + 21\" by auto\n\n  (* Step 7: We need \\( N < 50 \\), so we solve: \\( 24m + 21 < 50 \\). *)\n  have \"24*m < 29 \u27f6 m < 1.2083 \u27f6 m \u2264 1\" by auto\n\n  (* Step 8: The possible values for \\( m \\) are \\( 0 \\) and \\( 1 \\): *)\n  have \"N = 21\" if \"m = 0\" by auto\n  have \"N = 45\" if \"m = 1\" by auto\n\n  (* Step 9: The valid values of \\( N \\) are \\( 21 \\) and \\( 45 \\). *)\n  let ?sum = \"21 + 45\"\n  \n  (* Step 10: Finally, we compute the sum of all possible values of \\( N \\): \\( 21 + 45 = 66 \\). *)\n  show ?thesis by (simp add: ?sum)\nqed\n\nend\n```"}}
