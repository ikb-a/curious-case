Either $n-1$ or $n-2$ is odd, and the other is even.   Their product must yield an even number.   The only prime that is even is $2$, which is when $n$ is $3$ or $0$.

Show that it is 12.\n\n## Informal proof\nLet $y = x \\sin x$. It suffices to show that $12 \\leq \\frac{9y^2 + 4}{y}. It is trivial to see that $y > 0$. Then one can multiply both sides by $y$ and it suffices to show $12y \\leq 9y^2 + 4$.
