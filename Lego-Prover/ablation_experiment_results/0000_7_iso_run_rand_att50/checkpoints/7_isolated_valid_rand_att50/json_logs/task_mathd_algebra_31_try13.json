Show that it is 18.\n\n## Informal proof\nWe simplify $10a + b = 2(a+b)$ to get $8a = b$. Since $a$ is at least 1, $b$ is at least 8. We know $b$ is 8 since $8a = b$ and $a$ is a natural number. Hence $a$ is 1. The two-digit integer is hence $18$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem\n  fixes a b :: nat\n  assumes h0 : \"1\\<le>a \\<and> a \\<le>9 \\<and> b \\<le>9\"\n    and h1 : \"10 * a + b = 2 * (a+b)\"\n  shows \"10 * a + b = 18\"\n```\n\n## Structured informal proof\nStep 1. Simplify $10a + b = 2(a+b)$ to get $8a = b$.\nStep 2: Apply the constraint that $a$ is at least 1 to get that $b$ is at least 8.\nStep 3: Use the natural number condition for $a$ and $b$ to argue that $b = 8$ and $a = 1$ are the only viable solutions that satisfy the equation and constraints.\nStep 4: Conclude that the two-digit integer is $18$ as $10 * 1 + 8 = 18$.\n\n## Request skills\n### Thoughts 1\nThe solver needs to be comfortable working with Diophantine equations and natural numbers to find integer solutions for the given equation.\n\n### Code 1\n```isabelle\nlemma find_a_b_integer_solution:\n  fixes a b :: nat\n  assumes \n    \"1 \\<le> a \\<and> a \\<le> 9 \\<and> b \\<le> 9\"\n    \"10 * a + b = 2 * (a + b)\"\n  shows \"a = 1 \\<and> b = 8\"\n```\n\n\n\n####################\n\n## Problems\nGiven that  $$ \\begin{align*}x_{1}&=211,\\\\ x_{2}&=375,\\\\ x_{3}&=420,\\\\ x_{4}&=523,\\ \\text{and}\\\\ x_{n}&=x_{n-1}-x_{n-2}+x_{n-3}-x_{n-4}\\ \\text{when}\\ n\\geq5, \\end{align*} $$  find the value of $x_{531}+x_{753}+x_{975}$.

Since $531 = 106 \\cdot 5 + 1,\\ 753 = 150 \\cdot 5 + 3,\\ 975 = 194 \\cdot 5 + 5$, it follows that  $$x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975} = (-1)^{106} x_1 + (-1)^{150} x_3 + (-1)^{194} x_5 = 211 + 420 + 267 = 898.$$\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem\n  fixes x :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> int\"\n  assumes h0 : \"x 1 = 211\"\n    and h1 : \"x 2 = 375\"\n    and h2 : \"x 3 = 420\"\n    and h3 : \"x 4 = 523\"\n    and h4 : \"\\<And>(n::nat).

are **strongly encouraged** to create useful and reusable lemmas to solve the problem.\n- The lemmas should be as general as possible (generalizable), and be able to cover a large step in proofs
