It suffices to show $\\sqrt{2} \\leq x + \\frac{1}{2x}$. Let $y = \\sqrt{2}$. $y*y = 2$. Then $2x*x + 1 - 2x * \\sqrt{2} = y*y * x*x + 1 - 2xy = (xy - 1)^2 \\geq 0$. Also notice that $2x*x + 1 - 2x * \\sqrt{2} = 2x * (x + \\frac{1}{2x} - \\sqrt{2})$. Therefore $x + \\frac{1}{2x} - \\sqrt{2} \\geq 0$, given $2x > 0$.

The base case is trivial. Inductive case: when n is 0 it is also trivial. When $n>0$, let $m=2^n$, and we have $3^m - 1 \\equiv 4*m \\pmod{8*m}$. Then there is $k$ where $3^m - 1 = (8*m)*k + 4*m$. Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$ Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$.

If their teacher puts them in groups of 8, the last group has 5 students. If their teacher instead puts them in groups of 6, the last group has 3 students. What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nWe are given that $N\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $N\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$.  We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer. Thus the 2 solutions less than $50$ are 21 and $21+24(1) = 45$, and their sum is $21+45=66$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n```\n", "ai0": "## Structured informal proof\nStep 1: We start with the congruences given in the problem: \\( N \\equiv 5 \\mod 8 \\) and \\( N \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\).\n\nStep 2: We can express \\( N \\) in terms of the first congruence: \\( N = 8k + 5 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nStep 3: Substitute this expression into the second congruence: \n\\[\n8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6.\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Simplifying the left-hand side modulo 6 gives:\n\\[\n2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6.\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Rearranging this, we find:\n\\[\n2k \\equiv -2 \\mod 6 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 2k \\equiv 4 \\mod 6.\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Dividing through by 2 (noting that 2 and 6 are coprime), we have:\n\\[\nk \\equiv 2 \\mod 3.\n\\]\n\nStep 7: This means \\( k \\) can be expressed as \\( k = 3m + 2 \\) for some integer \\( m \\).\n\nStep 8: Substitute back into the expression for \\( N \\):\n\\[\nN = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21.\n\\]\n\nStep 9: We need \\( N < 50 \\), so we solve:\n\\[\n24m + 21 < 50 \\implies 24m < 29 \\implies m < \\frac{29}{24} \\implies m \\leq 1.\n\\]\n\nStep 10: The possible values for \\( m \\) are \\( 0 \\) and \\( 1 \\):\n- For \\( m = 0 \\): \\( N = 21 \\).\n- For \\( m = 1 \\): \\( N = 45 \\).\n\nStep 11: The valid values of \\( N \\) are \\( 21 \\) and \\( 45 \\).\n\nStep 12: Finally, we compute the sum of all possible values of \\( N \\):\n\\[\n21 + 45 = 66.\n\\]\n\n## Request skills\n### Thoughts 1\nUnderstanding of modular arithmetic is essential for manipulating the congruences.\n\n### Code 1\n```isabelle\nlemma mod_congruence:\n  fixes N k :: nat\n  assumes \"N mod 8 = 5\" \"N mod 6 = 3\"\n  shows \"N = 8k + 5\"\n```\n\n### Thoughts 2\nFamiliarity with the Chinese Remainder Theorem will help in solving the system of congruences.\n\n### Code 2\n```isabelle\nlemma chinese_remainder:\n  fixes a b m n :: nat\n  assumes \"a mod m = b\" \"a mod n = c\"\n  shows \"a mod (lcm m n) = d\"\n```\n\n### Thoughts 3\nProficiency in inequalities will be useful for ensuring \\( N < 50 \\).\n\n### Code 3\n```isabelle\nlemma less_than_50:\n  fixes N m :: nat\n  assumes \"N = 24m + 21\"\n  shows \"N < 50 \\<longleftrightarrow> m < 2\"\n```"}, "task": "data/full_data/debug/valid_rand/mathd_numbertheory_149.json", "success": false, "conversations": [["As a mathematician familiar with Isabelle, your task is to provide a formal proof in response to a given problem statement.\nYour proof should be structured and clearly written, meeting the following criteria:\n- It can be verified by Isabelle.\n- Each step of the proof should be explained in detail using comments enclosed in \"(*\" and \"*)\".\n- The explanation for each step should be clear and concise, avoiding any unnecessary or apologetic language.\n- You are **strongly encouraged** to create useful and reusable lemmas to solve the problem.\n- The lemmas should be as general as possible (generalizable), and be able to cover a large step in proofs (non-trivial).\n- You **MUST** copy the input lemma EXACTLY: **without changing whitespace**, without paraphrasing, and without adding comments.\nPlease ensure that your proof is well-organized and easy to follow, with each step building upon the previous one.", "Here some useful skill for reference:\n###### useful skill 1: ######\n```isabelle\nlemma modular_arithmetic:\n  fixes a b c :: nat\n  assumes \"a mod b = c\"\n  shows \"\\<exists>k. a = b * k + c\"\nproof -\n  have \"a = b * (a div b) + a mod b\"\n    by auto \n  then show ?thesis\n    using assms by auto\nqed\n```\n\n\n###### useful skill 2: ######\n```isabelle\nlemma nat_inequality:\n  fixes a b :: nat\n  assumes \"a < b\"\n  shows \"a + 1 \\<le> b\"\nproof -\n  have \"a + 1 \\<le> b\" using assms\n  proof -\n    have \"a + 1 \\<le> a + 1 + (b -

Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: We start with the congruences given in the problem: \\( N \\equiv 5 \\mod 8 \\) and \\( N \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\).\n\nStep 2: We can express \\( N \\) in terms of the first congruence: \\( N = 8k + 5 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nStep 3: Substitute this expression into the second congruence: \n\\[\n8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6.\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Simplifying the left-hand side modulo 6 gives:\n\\[\n2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6.\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Rearranging this, we find:\n\\[\n2k \\equiv -2 \\mod 6 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 2k \\equiv 4 \\mod 6.\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Dividing through by 2 (noting that 2 and 6 are coprime), we have:\n\\[\nk \\equiv 2 \\mod 3.\n\\]\n\nStep 7: This means \\( k \\) can be expressed as \\( k = 3m + 2 \\) for some integer \\( m \\).\n\nStep 8: Substitute back into the expression for \\( N \\):\n\\[\nN = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21.\n\\]\n\nStep 9: We need \\( N < 50 \\), so we solve:\n\\[\n24m + 21 < 50 \\implies 24m < 29 \\implies m < \\frac{29}{24} \\implies m \\leq 1.\n\\]\n\nStep 10: The possible values for \\( m \\) are \\( 0 \\) and \\( 1 \\):\n- For \\( m = 0 \\): \\( N = 21 \\).\n- For \\( m = 1 \\): \\( N = 45 \\).\n\nStep 11: The valid values of \\( N \\) are \\( 21 \\) and \\( 45 \\).\n\nStep 12: Finally, we compute the sum of all possible values of \\( N \\):\n\\[\n21 + 45 = 66.\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n```\n\n## Proof", "action_agent_ai0": "```isabelle\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_149\n  imports Complex_Main\nbegin\n\n(* Step 1: We start with the congruences given in the problem: \\( N \\equiv 5 \\mod 8 \\) and \\( N \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\). *)\nlemma congruences:\n  fixes N :: nat\n  assumes \"N < 50\" \"N mod 8 = 5\" \"N mod 6 = 3\"\n  shows \"N = 21 \u2228 N = 45\"\nproof -\n  (* Step 2: We can express \\( N \\) in terms of the first congruence: \\( N = 8k + 5 \\) for some integer \\( k \\). *)\n  obtain k where \"N = 8 * k + 5\" using assms(2) by auto\n  (* Substitute into the second congruence. *)\n  have \"8 * k + 5 mod 6 = 3\" \n    by (simp add: assms(3) mod_add_left_eq)\n  (* Step 4: Simplifying the left-hand side modulo 6 gives: \\( 2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\). *)\n  have \"2 * k + 5 mod 6 = 3\" \n    by (simp add: of_nat_eq_iff)\n  \n  (* Step 5: Rearranging this, we find: \\( 2k \\equiv -2 \\mod 6 \\) or \\( 2k \\equiv 4 \\mod 6 \\). *)\n  have \"2 * k mod 6 = 4\" by simp\n\n  (* Step 6: Dividing through by 2 (noting that 2 and 6 are coprime), we have: \\( k \\equiv 2 \\mod 3 \\). *)\n  have \"k mod 3 = 2\" \n    by (metis mod_divide_eq_0_iff_dvd)\n\n  (* Step 7: This means \\( k \\) can be expressed as \\( k = 3m + 2 \\) for some integer \\( m \\). *)\n  obtain m where \"k = 3 * m + 2\" by auto\n\n  (* Step 8: Substitute back into the expression for \\( N \\): \\( N = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 21 \\). *)\n  have \"N = 8 * (3 * m + 2) + 5\" by (simp add: `N = 8 * k + 5`)\n  thus \"N = 24 * m + 21\" by simp\n\n  (* Step 9: We need \\( N < 50 \\), so we solve: \\( 24m + 21 < 50 \\implies 24m < 29 \\implies m < \\frac{29}{24} \\implies m \\leq 1 \\). *)\n  have \"24 * m < 29\" by simp\n  then have \"m < 2\" by (smt (verit) divide_less_0_iff)\n\n  (* Step 10: The possible values for \\( m \\) are \\( 0 \\) and \\( 1 \\). *)\n  have \"m = 0 \u2228 m = 1\" by auto\n\n  (* For \\( m = 0 \\): \\( N = 21 \\). *)\n  have \"N = 21\" if \"m = 0\" using `N = 24 * m + 21` by auto\n\n  (* For \\( m = 1 \\): \\( N = 45 \\). *)\n  have \"N = 45\" if \"m = 1\" using `N = 24 * m + 21` by auto\n\n  (* Step 11: The valid values of \\( N \\) are \\( 21 \\) and \\( 45 \\). *)\n  show ?thesis using `N = 21 \u2228 N = 45` by auto\nqed\n\n(* Step 12: Finally, we compute the sum of all possible values of \\( N \\): \\( 21 + 45 = 66 \\). *)\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\nproof -\n  have \"21 \u2208 {x::nat. x<50 \u2227 x mod 8 = 5 \u2227 x mod 6 = 3}\"\n    by (simp add: congruences(1) congruences(2))\n  have \"45 \u2208 {x::nat. x<50 \u2227 x mod 8 = 5 \u2227 x mod 6 = 3}\"\n    by (simp add: congruences(1) congruences(2))\n  show ?thesis\n    by (simp add: sum.insert(1) sum.insert(2) add.commute)\nqed\n\nend\n```"}}
