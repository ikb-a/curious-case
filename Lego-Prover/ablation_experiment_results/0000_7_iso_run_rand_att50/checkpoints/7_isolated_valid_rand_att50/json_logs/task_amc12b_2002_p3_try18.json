The base case is trivial. Inductive case: when n is 0 it is also trivial. When $n>0$, let $m=2^n$, and we have $3^m - 1 \\equiv 4*m \\pmod{8*m}$. Then there is $k$ where $3^m - 1 = (8*m)*k + 4*m$. Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$ Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$.

3n + 2$ a [[prime]] number?  $\\mathrm{(A)}\\ \\text{none} \\qquad\\mathrm{(B)}\\ \\text{one} \\qquad\\mathrm{(C)}\\ \\text{two} \\qquad\\mathrm{(D)}\\ \\text{more\\ than\\ two,\\ but\\ finitely\\ many} \\qquad\\mathrm{(E)}\\ \\text{infinitely\\ many}$ Show that it is \\mathrm{(B)}\\ \\text{one}.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Start with the expression \\( n^2 - 3n + 2 \\) and factor it to obtain \\( (n-1)(n-2) \\).\n\nStep 2: Analyze the factors \\( n-1 \\) and \\( n-2 \\). Since \\( n \\) is a positive integer, both \\( n-1 \\) and \\( n-2 \\) are non-negative integers.\n\nStep 3: Determine the parity of \\( n-1 \\) and \\( n-2 \\). One of these factors will be odd and the other will be even, since they are consecutive integers.\n\nStep 4: Since the product \\( (n-1)(n-2) \\) is even, the only even prime number is \\( 2 \\). Therefore, we need to set \\( (n-1)(n-2) = 2 \\).\n\nStep 5: Solve the equation \\( (n-1)(n-2) = 2 \\). The pairs of factors of \\( 2 \\) are \\( (1, 2) \\) and \\( (2, 1) \\). This gives us the equations:\n- \\( n-1 = 2 \\) and \\( n-2 = 1 \\) leading to \\( n = 3 \\)\n- \\( n-1 = 1 \\) and \\( n-2 = 2 \\) leading to \\( n = 3 \\)\n\nStep 6: Verify that \\( n = 3 \\) is the only positive integer solution. For \\( n = 3 \\), we have \\( 3^2 - 3 \\cdot 3 + 2 = 2 \\), which is prime.\n\nStep 7: Conclude that there is only one positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( n^2 - 3n + 2 \\) is a prime number, which is \\( n = 3 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem amc12b_2002_p3:\n  fixes n ::nat\n  assumes \"n>0\"\n    and prime:\"prime (n^2+2-3*n)\"\n  shows \"n=3\"\n```\n\n## Proof"}}
