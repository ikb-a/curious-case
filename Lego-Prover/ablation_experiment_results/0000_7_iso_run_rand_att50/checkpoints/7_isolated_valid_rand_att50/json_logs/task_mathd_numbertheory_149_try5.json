We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer.

What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: We start with the congruences given in the problem: \\(N \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8}\\) and \\(N \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6}\\).\n\nStep 2: From the first congruence, we can express \\(N\\) in the form:\n\\[\nN = 8k + 5\n\\]\nfor some integer \\(k\\).\n\nStep 3: Substitute this expression into the second congruence:\n\\[\n8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6}\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6}\n\\]\nwhich further simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k \\equiv -2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{6}\n\\]\nDividing both sides by 2 (noting that 2 has an inverse modulo 6), we get:\n\\[\nk \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}\n\\]\n\nStep 4: We can express \\(k\\) in terms of another integer \\(m\\):\n\\[\nk = 3m + 2\n\\]\nfor some integer \\(m\\).\n\nStep 5: Substitute back into the expression for \\(N\\):\n\\[\nN = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Now we need to find values of \\(N\\) such that \\(N < 50\\):\n\\[\n24m + 21 < 50 \\implies 24m < 29 \\implies m < \\frac{29}{24} \\implies m \\leq 1\n\\]\nThus, \\(m\\) can take values \\(0\\) or \\(1\\).\n\nStep 7: Calculate the possible values of \\(N\\):\n- For \\(m = 0\\): \n\\[\nN = 24(0) + 21 = 21\n\\]\n- For \\(m = 1\\): \n\\[\nN = 24(1) + 21 = 45\n\\]\n\nStep 8: The possible values of \\(N\\) are \\(21\\) and \\(45\\). Their sum is:\n\\[\n21 + 45 = 66\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n```\n\n## Proof", "action_agent_ai0": "```isabelle\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_149\n  imports Complex_Main\nbegin\n\n(* We start with the congruences given in the problem: *)\nlemma congruences:\n  fixes N :: nat\n  assumes \"N < 50\"\n  shows \"N mod 8 = 5\" \"N mod 6 = 3\"\nproof -\n  (* Step 1: From the first congruence, we can express N in the form N = 8k + 5 for some integer k. *)\n  obtain k where k_def: \"N = 8 * k + 5\" \n    using assms(1) by (metis mod_8_eq_5)\n  \n  (* Step 2: Substitute this expression into the second congruence: 8k + 5 \u2261 3 mod 6. *)\n  have \"8 * k + 5 \u2261 3 mod 6\" \n    by (metis k_def mod_eq_0_iff_dvd)\n\n  (* This simplifies to: 2k + 5 \u2261 3 mod 6. *)\n  have \"2 * k + 5 \u2261 3 mod 6\" \n    using k_def by (metis mod_eq_0_iff_dvd)\n  \n  (* Step 3: Simplifying gives 2k \u2261 -2 \u2261 4 mod 6. *)\n  have \"2 * k \u2261 4 mod 6\" \n    by (metis (full_types) add.commute)\n\n  (* Dividing both sides by 2 (noting that 2 has an inverse modulo 6), we get: k \u2261 2 mod 3. *)\n  have \"k \u2261 2 mod 3\" \n    using gcd_dvd_trans[of 2 6] by auto\n\n  (* Step 4: We can express k in terms of another integer m: k = 3m + 2 for some integer m. *)\n  obtain m where k_exp: \"k = 3 * m + 2\" \n    using assms(1) by (metis mod_3_eq_2)\n\n  (* Step 5: Substitute back into the expression for N: N = 8(3m + 2) + 5. *)\n  have \"N = 8 * (3 * m + 2) + 5\" \n    using k_def by auto\n\n  (* This simplifies to: N = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21. *)\n  have \"N = 24 * m + 21\" by auto\n\n  (* Step 6: Now we need to find values of N such that N < 50: 24m + 21 < 50. *)\n  have \"24 * m + 21 < 50 \u27f7 24 * m < 29 \u27f7 m < 29/24 \u27f7 m \u2264 1.\" \n    by auto\n\n  (* Thus, m can take values 0 or 1. *)\n  have \"m = 0 \u2228 m = 1\" by auto\n  then show ?thesis \n    using k_exp by auto\nqed\n\n(* Calculating the possible values of N: *)\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\nproof -\n  have \"N = 21\" \n    by (metis congruences(1) congruences(2) k_def)\n  have \"N = 45\" \n    by (metis congruences(1) congruences(2) k_def)\n  \n  (* The possible values of N are 21 and 45.
