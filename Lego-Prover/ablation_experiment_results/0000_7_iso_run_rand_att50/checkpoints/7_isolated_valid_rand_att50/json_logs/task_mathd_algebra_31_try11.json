It suffices to show $\\sqrt{2} \\leq x + \\frac{1}{2x}$. Let $y = \\sqrt{2}$. $y*y = 2$. Then $2x*x + 1 - 2x * \\sqrt{2} = y*y * x*x + 1 - 2xy = (xy - 1)^2 \\geq 0$. Also notice that $2x*x + 1 - 2x * \\sqrt{2} = 2x * (x + \\frac{1}{2x} - \\sqrt{2})$. Therefore $x + \\frac{1}{2x} - \\sqrt{2} \\geq 0$, given $2x > 0$.
