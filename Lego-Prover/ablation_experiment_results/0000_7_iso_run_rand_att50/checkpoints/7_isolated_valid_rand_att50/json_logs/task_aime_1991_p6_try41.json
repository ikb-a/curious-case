Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nThere are $91 - 19 + 1 = 73$ numbers in the [[sequence]]. Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$. Solving shows that $\\frac{743}{100} \\le r < \\frac{744}{100}$, so $743\\le 100r < 744$, and $\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

(For real $x^{}_{}$, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the [[floor function|greatest integer]] less than or equal to $x^{}_{}$.) Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the summation. The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us 73 terms.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the possible values of the floor function. Since the terms can only differ by at most 1, the values of \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) can either be \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( n = \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\). Then, we can express the sum as:\n\\[\nx \\cdot n + (73 - x) \\cdot (n + 1) = 546\n\\]\nwhere \\( x \\) is the number of terms equal to \\( n + 1 \\).\n\nStep 4: Simplify the equation:\n\\[\nx \\cdot n + (73 - x) \\cdot (n + 1) = 546 \\implies x \\cdot n + 73n + 73 - x \\cdot n - 73 = 546 \\implies 73 + x = 546 \\implies x = 546 - 73 = 473\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Since \\( x \\) must be the number of terms equal to \\( n + 1 \\), we find that \\( x = 35 \\) and \\( 73 - x = 38 \\). This means there are 35 terms equal to \\( n + 1 \\) and 38 terms equal to \\( n \\).\n\nStep 6: Determine the value of \\( r \\). The first term that equals \\( n + 1 \\) occurs when \\( k = 57 \\):\n\\[\nn + 1 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < n + 2\n\\]\nThis gives us:\n\\[\nn + 1 - \\frac{57}{100} \\leq r < n + 2 - \\frac{57}{100}\n\\]\n\nStep 7: Substitute \\( n = 7 \\) (since \\( \\frac{546}{73} \\approx 7.48 \\)):\n\\[\n8 - \\frac{57}{100} \\leq r < 9 - \\frac{57}{100} \\implies 7.43 \\leq r < 7.44\n\\]\n\nStep 8: Multiply by 100 to find \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor \\):\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744 \\implies \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
