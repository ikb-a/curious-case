Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$.

The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us 73 terms.\n\nStep 2: Since the floor function can only change by 1 at most between consecutive terms, the values of \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) for \\( k = 19, 20, \\ldots, 91 \\) can either be \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor = n \\). Then, we can express the sum as:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=19}^{91} \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = \\sum_{k=19}^{91} (n + m_k)\n\\]\nwhere \\( m_k \\) is 0 or 1 depending on whether \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) is less than or greater than \\( n + 1 \\).\n\nStep 4: The total number of terms is 73, so we can write:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=19}^{91} \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = 73n + \\sum_{k=19}^{91} m_k\n\\]\nLet \\( t \\) be the number of terms where \\( m_k = 1 \\). Then, we have:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=19}^{91} m_k = t\n\\]\nand thus:\n\\[\n73n + t = 546\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Rearranging gives:\n\\[\nt = 546 - 73n\n\\]\nSince \\( t \\) must be a non-negative integer, we have:\n\\[\n546 - 73n \\geq 0 \\implies n \\leq \\frac{546}{73} \\approx 7.48\n\\]\nThus, \\( n \\) can be at most 7.\n\nStep 6: Now, we check possible values for \\( n \\):\n- If \\( n = 7 \\):\n  \\[\n  t = 546 - 73 \\cdot 7 = 547 - 511 = 35\n  \\]\n- If \\( n = 6 \\):\n  \\[\n  t = 546 - 73 \\cdot 6 = 546 - 438 = 108\n  \\]\n- If \\( n = 5 \\):\n  \\[\n  t = 546 - 73 \\cdot 5 = 546 - 365 = 181\n  \\]\n- If \\( n = 4 \\):\n  \\[\n  t = 546 - 73 \\cdot 4 = 546 - 292 = 254\n  \\]\n- If \\( n = 3 \\):\n  \\[\n  t = 546 - 73 \\cdot 3 = 546 - 219 = 327\n  \\]\n- If \\( n = 2 \\):\n  \\[\n  t = 546 - 73 \\cdot 2 = 546 - 146 = 400\n  \\]\n- If \\( n = 1 \\):\n  \\[\n  t = 546 - 73 \\cdot 1 = 546 - 73 = 473\n  \\]\n- If \\( n = 0 \\):\n  \\[\n  t = 546 - 73 \\cdot 0 = 546\n  \\]\n\nStep 7: Since \\( t \\) must be less than or equal to 73, we find that \\( n = 7 \\) is the only feasible solution. \n\nStep 8: Now, we need to find \\( r \\):\n\\[\n7 \\leq r < 8\n\\]\nFor \\( k = 57 \\):\n\\[\n\\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\implies 8 \\leq r + 0.57 < 9 \\implies 7.43 \\leq r < 8.00\n\\]\n\nStep 9: Therefore, multiplying by 100 gives:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 800\n\\]\nThus, \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
