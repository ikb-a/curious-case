Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$.

Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the summation. The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us a total of \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that the floor function can yield either \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor = n \\) or \\( n + 1 \\) for some integer \\( n \\). Since the terms can differ by at most 1, we can denote the number of terms equal to \\( n \\) as \\( x \\) and those equal to \\( n + 1 \\) as \\( y \\).\n\nStep 3: Set up the equations based on the total number of terms and their sum:\n- \\( x + y = 73 \\)\n- \\( nx + (n + 1)y = 546 \\)\n\nStep 4: Substitute \\( y = 73 - x \\) into the second equation:\n\\[\nnx + (n + 1)(73 - x) = 546\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\nnx + 73n + 73 - nx - x = 546\n\\]\n\\[\n73n + 73 - x = 546\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 73n + 73 - 546\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 73n - 473\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Since \\( x \\) must be non-negative, we have:\n\\[\n73n - 473 \\geq 0 \\implies n \\geq \\frac{473}{73} \\approx 6.5\n\\]\nThus, \\( n \\) must be at least 7.\n\nStep 6: If \\( n = 7 \\), then substituting back gives:\n\\[\nx = 73 \\cdot 7 - 473 = 511 - 473 = 38\n\\]\nThis means \\( y = 73 - 38 = 35 \\).\n\nStep 7: If \\( n = 8 \\), then:\n\\[\nx = 73 \\cdot 8 - 473 = 584 - 473 = 111\n\\]\nThis is not possible since \\( x + y \\) must equal 73.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, we conclude \\( n = 7 \\) and \\( y = 35 \\) implies that 35 terms are equal to 8 and 38 terms are equal to 7.\n\nStep 9: The first term where the value is 8 occurs at \\( k = 57 \\):\n\\[\n\\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\implies 8 \\leq r + 0.57 < 8.01\n\\]\nThis leads to:\n\\[\n7.43 \\leq r < 7.44\n\\]\n\nStep 10: Multiplying through by 100 gives:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744\n\\]\nThus, \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
