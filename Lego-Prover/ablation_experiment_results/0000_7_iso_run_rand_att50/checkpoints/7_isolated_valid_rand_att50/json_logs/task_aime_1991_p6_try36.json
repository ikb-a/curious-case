Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nThere are $91 - 19 + 1 = 73$ numbers in the [[sequence]]. Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$. Solving shows that $\\frac{743}{100} \\le r < \\frac{744}{100}$, so $743\\le 100r < 744$, and $\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

The sum can be expressed as:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of terms equal to } n \\times n + \\text{Number of terms equal to } n + 1 \\times (n + 1) = 546.\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Let \\( x \\) be the number of terms equal to \\( n + 1 \\). Then, the number of terms equal to \\( n \\) is \\( 73 - x \\).

This gives us a total of \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms in the sum.\n\nStep 2: Since the floor function can only change by at most 1 for consecutive values of \\( k \\), the values of \\( \\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\rfloor \\) for \\( k = 19, 20, \\ldots, 91 \\) can either be \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( n = \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\). The sum can be expressed as:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of terms equal to } n \\times n + \\text{Number of terms equal to } n + 1 \\times (n + 1) = 546.\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Let \\( x \\) be the number of terms equal to \\( n + 1 \\). Then, the number of terms equal to \\( n \\) is \\( 73 - x \\). The equation becomes:\n\\[\n(n)(73 - x) + (n + 1)x = 546.\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n73n + x = 546 \\implies x = 546 - 73n.\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Since \\( x \\) must be non-negative, we have:\n\\[\n546 - 73n \\geq 0 \\implies n \\leq \\frac{546}{73} \\approx 7.48.\n\\]\nThus, \\( n \\) can be at most 7.\n\nStep 6: If \\( n = 7 \\), then:\n\\[\nx = 546 - 73 \\cdot 7 = 35.\n\\]\nThis means there are 35 terms equal to \\( 8 \\) and \\( 73 - 35 = 38 \\) terms equal to \\( 7 \\).\n\nStep 7: The first term that equals \\( 8 \\) occurs when \\( k = 57 \\):\n\\[\n\\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\implies 8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01.\n\\]\nThis leads to:\n\\[\n8 - \\frac{57}{100} \\leq r < 8.01 - \\frac{57}{100} \\implies \\frac{743}{100} \\leq r < \\frac{744}{100}.\n\\]\n\nStep 8: Therefore, multiplying by 100 gives:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744 \\implies \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743.\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

Then, the number of terms equal to \\( n \\) is \\( 73 - x \\). The equation becomes:\n\\[\n(n)(73 - x) + (n + 1)x = 546.\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n73n + x = 546 \\implies x = 546 - 73n.\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Since \\( x \\) must be non-negative, we have:\n\\[\n546 - 73n \\geq 0 \\implies n \\leq \\frac{546}{73} \\approx 7.48.\n\\]\nThus, \\( n \\) can be at most 7.\n\nStep 6: If \\( n = 7 \\), then:\n\\[\nx = 546 - 73 \\cdot 7 = 35.\n\\]\nThis means there are 35 terms equal to \\( 8 \\) and \\( 73 - 35 = 38 \\) terms equal to \\( 7 \\).\n\nStep 7: The first term that equals \\( 8 \\) occurs when \\( k = 57 \\):\n\\[\n\\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\implies 8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01.\n\\]\nThis leads to:\n\\[\n8 - \\frac{57}{100} \\leq r < 8.01 - \\frac{57}{100} \\implies \\frac{743}{100} \\leq r < \\frac{744}{100}.\n\\]\n\nStep 8: Therefore, multiplying by 100 gives:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744 \\implies \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743.\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
