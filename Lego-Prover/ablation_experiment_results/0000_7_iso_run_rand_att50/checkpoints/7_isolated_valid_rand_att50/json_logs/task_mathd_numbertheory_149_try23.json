If $b=0$, $a^2 mod 3 = 0^2 mod 3 = 0$; If $b=1$, $a^2 mod 3 = 1^2 mod 3 = 1$; If $b=2$, $a^2 mod 3 = 2^2 mod 3 = 1$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem\n  fixes a :: int\n  shows \"a^2 mod 3 = 0 \\<or> a^2 mod 3 = 1\"\n```\n\n## Structured informal proof\nStep 1: Introduce a new variable $b$ such that $b = a \\mod 3$.

Also notice that $2x*x + 1 - 2x * \\sqrt{2} = 2x * (x + \\frac{1}{2x} - \\sqrt{2})$. Therefore $x + \\frac{1}{2x} - \\sqrt{2} \\geq 0$, given $2x > 0$.

If their teacher puts them in groups of 8, the last group has 5 students. If their teacher instead puts them in groups of 6, the last group has 3 students. What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nWe are given that $N\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $N\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$.  We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer. Thus the 2 solutions less than $50$ are 21 and $21+24(1) = 45$, and their sum is $21+45=66$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n```\n", "ai0": "## Structured informal proof\nStep 1: We start with the congruences given in the problem: \\( N \\equiv 5 \\mod 8 \\) and \\( N \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\).\n\nStep 2: From the first congruence, we can express \\( N \\) in the form:\n\\[\nN = 8k + 5\n\\]\nfor some integer \\( k \\).\n\nStep 3: Substitute this expression into the second congruence:\n\\[\n8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6\n\\]\nwhich further simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k \\equiv -2 \\mod 6 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 2k \\equiv 4 \\mod 6\n\\]\nDividing through by 2 (noting that 2 and 6 are coprime), we have:\n\\[\nk \\equiv 2 \\mod 3\n\\]\n\nStep 4: This means we can express \\( k \\) as:\n\\[\nk = 3m + 2\n\\]\nfor some integer \\( m \\).\n\nStep 5: Substitute back into the expression for \\( N \\):\n\\[\nN = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Now we need to find values of \\( N \\) that are less than 50:\n\\[\n24m + 21 < 50\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n24m < 29 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad m < \\frac{29}{24} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad m \\leq 1\n\\]\n\nStep 7: The possible values for \\( m \\) are \\( 0 \\) and \\( 1 \\):\n- For \\( m = 0 \\): \\( N = 24(0) + 21 = 21 \\)\n- For \\( m = 1 \\): \\( N = 24(1) + 21 = 45 \\)\n\nStep 8: The valid values of \\( N \\) are \\( 21 \\) and \\( 45 \\).

Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: We start with the congruences given in the problem: \\( N \\equiv 5 \\mod 8 \\) and \\( N \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\).\n\nStep 2: From the first congruence, we can express \\( N \\) in the form:\n\\[\nN = 8k + 5\n\\]\nfor some integer \\( k \\).\n\nStep 3: Substitute this expression into the second congruence:\n\\[\n8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6\n\\]\nwhich further simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k \\equiv -2 \\mod 6 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 2k \\equiv 4 \\mod 6\n\\]\nDividing through by 2 (noting that 2 and 6 are coprime), we have:\n\\[\nk \\equiv 2 \\mod 3\n\\]\n\nStep 4: This means we can express \\( k \\) as:\n\\[\nk = 3m + 2\n\\]\nfor some integer \\( m \\).\n\nStep 5: Substitute back into the expression for \\( N \\):\n\\[\nN = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Now we need to find values of \\( N \\) that are less than 50:\n\\[\n24m + 21 < 50\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n24m < 29 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad m < \\frac{29}{24} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad m \\leq 1\n\\]\n\nStep 7: The possible values for \\( m \\) are \\( 0 \\) and \\( 1 \\):\n- For \\( m = 0 \\): \\( N = 24(0) + 21 = 21 \\)\n- For \\( m = 1 \\): \\( N = 24(1) + 21 = 45 \\)\n\nStep 8: The valid values of \\( N \\) are \\( 21 \\) and \\( 45 \\). Their sum is:\n\\[\n21 + 45 = 66\n\\]\n\nStep 9: Thus, we conclude that the sum of all possible values of \\( N \\) is \\( 66 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n```\n\n## Proof", "action_agent_ai0": "```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\nproof -\n  (* Step 1: We start with the congruences given in the problem: \\( N \\equiv 5 \\mod 8 \\) and \\( N \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\). *)\n  \n  let ?N = \"{x::nat. x < 50 \\<and> x mod 8 = 5 \\<and> x mod 6 = 3}\"\n\n  (* Step 2: From the first congruence, we can express \\( N \\) in the form \\( N = 8k + 5 \\) for some integer \\( k \\). *)\n  have \"k \\<in> {0..6}\" (* Because \\( 8k + 5 < 50 \\) gives \\( k < 5.625 \\) *) \n    using le_divide_eq[of 50 8] by simp\n\n  (* Step 3: Substitute this expression into the second congruence.
