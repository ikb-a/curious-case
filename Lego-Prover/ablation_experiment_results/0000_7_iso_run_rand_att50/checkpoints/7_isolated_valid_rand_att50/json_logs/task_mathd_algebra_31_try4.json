Show that it is 512.\n\n## Informal proof\nWe first calculate that $\\log_2=1$, $\\log_4=2$, and $\\log_8=3$. Then let $c=\\log_a$ and $d=\\log_b$. We can write the equations as $\\frac{c}{3} + 2*\\frac{d}{2}=5$ and $\\frac{d}{3} + 2*\\frac{c}{2}=7$. Solving the equations and we get $c=6$ and $d=3$. Hence $a=2^6=64$ and $b=2^3=8$.
