We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer.

If their teacher puts them in groups of 8, the last group has 5 students. If their teacher instead puts them in groups of 6, the last group has 3 students. What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Define \\( N \\) as the number of students. We know from the problem that \\( N \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8} \\) and \\( N \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6} \\).\n\nStep 2: From the first congruence \\( N \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8} \\), we can express \\( N \\) in the form:\n\\[\nN = 8k + 5\n\\]\nfor some integer \\( k \\).\n\nStep 3: Substitute \\( N \\) into the second congruence \\( N \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6} \\):\n\\[\n8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6}\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Simplify the left-hand side:\n\\[\n8k \\equiv 2k \\pmod{6} \\quad (\\text{since } 8 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{6})\n\\]\nThus, we have:\n\\[\n2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6}\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Rearranging gives:\n\\[\n2k \\equiv 3 - 5 \\equiv -2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{6}\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Dividing both sides by 2 (noting that 2 has an inverse modulo 6):\n\\[\nk \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}\n\\]\nThis means:\n\\[\nk = 3m + 2\n\\]\nfor some integer \\( m \\).\n\nStep 7: Substitute back into the expression for \\( N \\):\n\\[\nN = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21\n\\]\n\nStep 8: Now we need to find values of \\( N \\) such that \\( N < 50 \\):\n\\[\n24m + 21 < 50 \\implies 24m < 29 \\implies m < \\frac{29}{24} \\implies m = 0 \\text{ or } 1\n\\]\n\nStep 9: Calculate possible values of \\( N \\):\n- For \\( m = 0 \\): \\( N = 21 \\)\n- For \\( m = 1 \\): \\( N = 45 \\)\n\nStep 10: The possible values of \\( N \\) are 21 and 45. Their sum is:\n\\[\n21 + 45 = 66\n\\]\n\nThus, we conclude that the sum of all possible values of \\( N \\) is \\( 66 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n```\n\n## Proof", "action_agent_ai0": "```isabelle\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_149\n  imports Complex_Main\nbegin\n\n(* lemma to express N in terms of k for the first congruence *)\nlemma congruence_8:\n  fixes k :: nat\n  shows \"N = 8 * k + 5\"\n  by (simp add: algebra_simps)\n\n(* lemma to express N in terms of m for the second congruence *)\nlemma congruence_6:\n  fixes m :: nat\n  shows \"N = 24 * m + 21\"\n  by (simp add: algebra_simps)\n\n(* formal statement copy from the input *)\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\nproof -\n  (* Step 1: Define \\( N \\) as the number of students.
