We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer. Thus the 2 solutions less than $50$ are 21 and $21+24(1) = 45$, and their sum is $21+45=66$.", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_149 \n  imports Complex_Main \"HOL-Computational_Algebra.Computational_Algebra\"\n  \"HOL-Number_Theory.Number_Theory\"\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n  sorry\n\nend   "}, "verified_result": {"success": false, "reason": "Step error: Type unification failed: No type arity fun :: numeral\n\nType error in application: operator not of function type\n\nOperator:  8::??'a :: ??'a\nOperand:   k :: nat\n\nCoercion Inference:\n\nLocal coercion insertion on the operator failed:\nNo complex coercion from \"??'a25\" to fun\nAt command \"'have \"N = 8k + 5\" for k :: nat'\" (line 13)", "num_steps": 49, "last_step": 8, "error_step_index": 7, "step_results": [{"index": 0, "step": "theory mathd_numbertheory_149\n  imports Complex_Main\nbegin", "output": "", "step_time": 0.007673740386962891}, {"index": 1, "step": "\n\n(* formal statement copy from the input *)\n", "output": "", "step_time": 0.0072405338287353516}, {"index": 2, "step": "theorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"", "output": "proof (prove)\ngoal (1 subgoal):\n 1. \\<Sum> {x. x < 50 \\<and> x mod 8 = 5 \\<and> x mod 6 = 3} = 66", "step_time": 0.01706838607788086}, {"index": 3, "step": "proof -", "output": "proof (state)\ngoal (1 subgoal):\n 1. \\<Sum> {x. x < 50 \\<and> x mod 8 = 5 \\<and> x mod 6 = 3} = 66", "step_time": 0.009618520736694336}, {"index": 4, "step": "\n  (* Step 1: Define the set of students N based on the conditions given in the problem statement. *)\n  ", "output": "proof (state)\ngoal (1 subgoal):\n 1. \\<Sum> {x. x < 50 \\<and> x mod 8 = 5 \\<and> x mod 6 = 3} = 66", "step_time": 0.009971380233764648}, {"index": 5, "step": "let ?S = \"{x::nat. x < 50 \\<and> x mod 8 = 5 \\<and> x mod 6 = 3}\"", "output": "proof (state)\ngoal (1 subgoal):\n 1. \\<Sum> {x. x < 50 \\<and> x mod 8 = 5 \\<and> x mod 6 = 3} = 66", "step_time": 0.014258384704589844}, {"index": 6, "step": "\n  \n  (* Step 2: Find the elements satisfying both congruences.
