Show that it is 512.\n\n## Informal proof\nWe first calculate that $\\log_2=1$, $\\log_4=2$, and $\\log_8=3$. Then let $c=\\log_a$ and $d=\\log_b$. We can write the equations as $\\frac{c}{3} + 2*\\frac{d}{2}=5$ and $\\frac{d}{3} + 2*\\frac{c}{2}=7$. Solving the equations and we get $c=6$ and $d=3$. Hence $a=2^6=64$ and $b=2^3=8$.

It suffices to show $\\sqrt{2} \\leq x + \\frac{1}{2x}$. Let $y = \\sqrt{2}$. $y*y = 2$. Then $2x*x + 1 - 2x * \\sqrt{2} = y*y * x*x + 1 - 2xy = (xy - 1)^2 \\geq 0$. Also notice that $2x*x + 1 - 2x * \\sqrt{2} = 2x * (x + \\frac{1}{2x} - \\sqrt{2})$. Therefore $x + \\frac{1}{2x} - \\sqrt{2} \\geq 0$, given $2x > 0$.

(For real $x^{}_{}$, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the [[floor function|greatest integer]] less than or equal to $x^{}_{}$.) Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nThere are $91 - 19 + 1 = 73$ numbers in the [[sequence]]. Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$. Solving shows that $\\frac{743}{100} \\le r < \\frac{744}{100}$, so $743\\le 100r < 744$, and $\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Identify the range of the summation. The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us a total of \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that the values of \\( \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\right\\rfloor \\) can only differ by at most 1 for consecutive \\( k \\) values, meaning they can either be \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( n = \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\). Then, we can express the sum as:\n\\[\nx \\cdot n + (73 - x) \\cdot (n + 1) = 546\n\\]\nwhere \\( x \\) is the number of terms equal to \\( n + 1 \\).\n\nStep 4: Simplifying the equation gives:\n\\[\nx \\cdot n + (73 - x) \\cdot (n + 1) = 546 \\implies 73n + 73 - x = 546 \\implies 73 - x = 546 - 73n\n\\]\nThus, we have:\n\\[\nx = 73 - (546 - 73n) = 73n - 473\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Since \\( x \\) must be a non-negative integer, we derive the inequality:\n\\[\n73n - 473 \\geq 0 \\implies n \\geq \\frac{473}{73} \\approx 6.5 \\implies n \\geq 7\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Next, we also need to ensure that \\( x \\) does not exceed 73:\n\\[\n73n - 473 \\leq 73 \\implies 73n \\leq 546 \\implies n \\leq \\frac{546}{73} \\approx 7.48 \\implies n \\leq 7\n\\]\n\nStep 7: Combining the inequalities, we find \\( n = 7 \\).\n\nStep 8: Substitute \\( n = 7 \\) back into the equation for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = 73 \\cdot 7 - 473 = 511 - 473 = 38\n\\]\n\nStep 9: This means there are 38 terms equal to 8 and \\( 73 - 38 = 35 \\) terms equal to 7.\n\nStep 10: The first term where the value is 8 occurs at \\( k = 57 \\):\n\\[\n\\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\implies 8 \\leq r + 0.57 < 8.01\n\\]\n\nStep 11: Rearranging gives:\n\\[\n7.43 \\leq r < 7.44\n\\]\n\nStep 12: Finally, multiplying by 100 gives:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744 \\implies \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us a total of \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that the values of \\( \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\right\\rfloor \\) can only differ by at most 1 for consecutive \\( k \\) values, meaning they can either be \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( n = \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\).
