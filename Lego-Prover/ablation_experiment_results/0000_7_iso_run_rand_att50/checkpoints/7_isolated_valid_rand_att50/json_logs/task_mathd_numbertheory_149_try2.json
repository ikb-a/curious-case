We can write the equations as $\\frac{c}{3} + 2*\\frac{d}{2}=5$ and $\\frac{d}{3} + 2*\\frac{c}{2}=7$. Solving the equations and we get $c=6$ and $d=3$. Hence $a=2^6=64$ and $b=2^3=8$.

If their teacher puts them in groups of 8, the last group has 5 students. If their teacher instead puts them in groups of 6, the last group has 3 students. What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nWe are given that $N\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $N\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$.  We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer. Thus the 2 solutions less than $50$ are 21 and $21+24(1) = 45$, and their sum is $21+45=66$.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n```\n", "ai0": "## Structured informal proof\nStep 1: We start with the congruences given in the problem: \\( N \\equiv 5 \\mod 8 \\) and \\( N \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\).\n\nStep 2: To find values of \\( N \\) that satisfy both congruences, we can express \\( N \\) in terms of the first congruence.
