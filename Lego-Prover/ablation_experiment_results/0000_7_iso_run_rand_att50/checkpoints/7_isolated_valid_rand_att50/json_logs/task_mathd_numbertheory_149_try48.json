We can write the equations as $\\frac{c}{3} + 2*\\frac{d}{2}=5$ and $\\frac{d}{3} + 2*\\frac{c}{2}=7$. Solving the equations and we get $c=6$ and $d=3$. Hence $a=2^6=64$ and $b=2^3=8$.

What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nWe are given that $N\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $N\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$.  We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer.

Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: Start with the given equations: \n1. \\(\\log_8 a + \\log_4 b^2 = 5\\)\n2. \\(\\log_8 b + \\log_4 a^2 = 7\\)\n\nStep 2: Convert the logarithms to base 2:\n- \\(\\log_8 a = \\frac{\\log_2 a}{\\log_2 8} = \\frac{\\log_2 a}{3}\\)\n- \\(\\log_4 b^2 = 2 \\cdot \\log_4 b = 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\log_2 b}{\\log_2 4} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\log_2 b}{2} = \\log_2 b\\)\n- \\(\\log_8 b = \\frac{\\log_2 b}{3}\\)\n- \\(\\log_4 a^2 = 2 \\cdot \\log_4 a = 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\log_2 a}{\\log_2 4} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\log_2 a}{2} = \\log_2 a\\)\n\nStep 3: Substitute these into the original equations:\n1. \\(\\frac{\\log_2 a}{3} + \\log_2 b = 5\\)\n2. \\(\\frac{\\log_2 b}{3} + \\log_2 a = 7\\)\n\nStep 4: Let \\(c = \\log_2 a\\) and \\(d = \\log_2 b\\). The equations become:\n1. \\(\\frac{c}{3} + d = 5\\)\n2. \\(\\frac{d}{3} + c = 7\\)\n\nStep 5: Multiply the first equation by 3 to eliminate the fraction:\n- \\(c + 3d = 15\\) (Equation 1)\n\nStep 6: Multiply the second equation by 3:\n- \\(d + 3c = 21\\) (Equation 2)\n\nStep 7: Now we have a system of linear equations:\n1. \\(c + 3d = 15\\)\n2. \\(d + 3c = 21\\)\n\nStep 8: Solve this system. From Equation 1, express \\(c\\) in terms of \\(d\\):\n- \\(c = 15 - 3d\\)\n\nStep 9: Substitute \\(c\\) into Equation 2:\n- \\(d + 3(15 - 3d) = 21\\)\n- \\(d + 45 - 9d = 21\\)\n- \\(-8d + 45 = 21\\)\n- \\(-8d = 21 - 45\\)\n- \\(-8d = -24\\)\n- \\(d = 3\\)\n\nStep 10: Substitute \\(d = 3\\) back into Equation 1 to find \\(c\\):\n- \\(c + 3(3) = 15\\)\n- \\(c + 9 = 15\\)\n- \\(c = 6\\)\n\nStep 11: Now we have \\(c = \\log_2 a = 6\\) and \\(d = \\log_2 b = 3\\). \n\nStep 12: Convert back to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\):\n- \\(a = 2^6 = 64\\)\n- \\(b = 2^3 = 8\\)\n\nStep 13: Finally, calculate \\(ab\\):\n- \\(ab = 64 \\cdot 8 = 512\\)\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n```\n\n## Proof", "action_agent_ai0": "```isabelle\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_149\n  imports Complex_Main\nbegin\n\n(* formal statement copy from the input*)\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\nproof -\n  (* Step 1: Define the set of valid N values based on the conditions given in the problem statement. *)\n  let ?S = \"{x::nat. x < 50 \\<and> x mod 8 = 5 \\<and> x mod 6 = 3}\"\n  \n  (* Step 2: Find the values of N satisfying both modular equations. *)\n  (* The condition x mod 8 = 5 gives possible values: 5, 13, 21, 29, 37, 45. *)\n  have \"5 + 8 * k\" for k::nat\n    shows \"5 + 8 * k < 50\" \n    by (metis less_numeral_extra(3) mult.commute)\n\n  (* Now we check which of these values also satisfy the second condition, x mod 6 = 3. *)\n  have \"5 mod 6 = 5\" \n    by simp\n  have \"13 mod 6 = 1\" \n    by simp\n  have \"21 mod 6 = 3\" \n    by simp\n  have \"29 mod 6 = 5\" \n    by simp\n  have \"37 mod 6 = 1\" \n    by simp\n  have \"45 mod 6 = 3\" \n    by simp\n  \n  (* The valid values for N are: 21 and 45. *)\n  let ?valid_Ns = \"{21, 45}\"\n\n  (* Step 3: Sum the valid values of N. *)\n  have \"sum ?valid_Ns = 21 + 45 = 66\"\n    by simp\n\n  (* Step 4: Return the result. *)\n  show ?thesis \n    by (simp add: \"66\")\nqed\n\nend\n```"}}
