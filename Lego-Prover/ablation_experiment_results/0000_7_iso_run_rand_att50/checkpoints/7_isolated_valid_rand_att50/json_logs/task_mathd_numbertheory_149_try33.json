If their teacher puts them in groups of 8, the last group has 5 students. If their teacher instead puts them in groups of 6, the last group has 3 students. What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: We start with the congruences given in the problem: \\( N \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8} \\) and \\( N \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6} \\).\n\nStep 2: From the first congruence, we can express \\( N \\) in the form:\n\\[\nN = 8k + 5\n\\]\nfor some integer \\( k \\).\n\nStep 3: Substitute this expression into the second congruence:\n\\[\n8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6}\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6}\n\\]\nwhich further simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k \\equiv -2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{6}\n\\]\nDividing both sides by 2 gives:\n\\[\nk \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}\n\\]\n\nStep 4: We can express \\( k \\) in terms of another integer \\( m \\):\n\\[\nk = 3m + 2\n\\]\nfor some integer \\( m \\).\n\nStep 5: Substitute back into the expression for \\( N \\):\n\\[\nN = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Now we need to find values of \\( N \\) such that \\( N < 50 \\):\n\\[\n24m + 21 < 50 \\implies 24m < 29 \\implies m < \\frac{29}{24} \\implies m \\leq 1\n\\]\n\nStep 7: Calculate possible values of \\( N \\) for \\( m = 0 \\) and \\( m = 1 \\):\n- For \\( m = 0 \\):\n\\[\nN = 24(0) + 21 = 21\n\\]\n- For \\( m = 1 \\):\n\\[\nN = 24(1) + 21 = 45\n\\]\n\nStep 8: The possible values of \\( N \\) are 21 and 45. \n\nStep 9: Finally, we sum these values:\n\\[\n21 + 45 = 66\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n```\n\n## Proof", "action_agent_ai0": "```isabelle\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_149\n  imports Complex_Main\nbegin\n\n(* Here I will copy the formal statement from the input directly *)\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\nproof -\n  (* Step 1: Define the set of valid N based on the given congruences. *)\n  let ?S = \"{x::nat. x < 50 \\<and> x mod 8 = 5 \\<and> x mod 6 = 3}\"\n\n  (* Step 2: Analyze the conditions for the set.
