Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$.

The sum involves the floor function applied to \\( r + \\frac{k}{100} \\) for \\( k \\) ranging from 19 to 91, which gives us 73 terms.\n\nStep 2: Since the floor function can only take integer values, we note that each term \\( \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\right\\rfloor \\) can either be \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\). \n\nStep 3: Let \\( n = \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\). The number of terms that equal \\( n \\) will be \\( 73 - m \\) and those that equal \\( n + 1 \\) will be \\( m \\), where \\( m \\) is the number of terms that take the value \\( n + 1 \\).\n\nStep 4: The total sum can be expressed as:\n\\[\n(73 - m) n + m(n + 1) = 546\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n73n + m = 546\n\\]\nThus, we have:\n\\[\nm = 546 - 73n\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Since \\( m \\) must be a non-negative integer, we require:\n\\[\n546 - 73n \\geq 0 \\implies n \\leq \\frac{546}{73} \\approx 7.48\n\\]\nThis means \\( n \\) can take values 0 through 7.\n\nStep 6: We also need to ensure that \\( m \\) does not exceed the total number of terms, which is 73:\n\\[\nm \\leq 73 \\implies 546 - 73n \\leq 73 \\implies 546 - 73 \\leq 73n \\implies 473 \\leq 73n \\implies n \\geq \\frac{473}{73} \\approx 6.48\n\\]\nThus, \\( n \\) can only be 7.\n\nStep 7: Substitute \\( n = 7 \\) back into the equation for \\( m \\):\n\\[\nm = 546 - 73 \\cdot 7 = 546 - 511 = 35\n\\]\nThis means there are 35 terms equal to 8 and \\( 73 - 35 = 38 \\) terms equal to 7.\n\nStep 8: The first term where the value is 8 occurs at \\( k = 57 \\):\n\\[\n\\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\rfloor = 8 \\implies 8 \\leq r + 0.57 < 9\n\\]\nThis gives:\n\\[\n7.43 \\leq r < 8.43\n\\]\n\nStep 9: Multiply through by 100 to find \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor \\):\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 843\n\\]\nThus, \\( \\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743 \\).\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
