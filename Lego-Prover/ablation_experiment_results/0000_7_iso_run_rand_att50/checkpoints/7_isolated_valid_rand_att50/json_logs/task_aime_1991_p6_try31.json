Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$.

The base case is trivial. Inductive case: when n is 0 it is also trivial. When $n>0$, let $m=2^n$, and we have $3^m - 1 \\equiv 4*m \\pmod{8*m}$. Then there is $k$ where $3^m - 1 = (8*m)*k + 4*m$. Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$ Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$. Therefore the inductive case holds.

(For real $x^{}_{}$, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the [[floor function|greatest integer]] less than or equal to $x^{}_{}$.) Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: We start with the equation given in the problem, which states that the sum of the floor functions from \\( \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{19}{100} \\right\\rfloor \\) to \\( \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{91}{100} \\right\\rfloor \\) equals 546. There are \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms in this sum.\n\nStep 2: Since the floor function can only change by at most 1 as \\( k \\) varies from 19 to 91, the values of \\( \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\right\\rfloor \\) can only be either \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( n = \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\). Then, we can express the sum as:\n\\[\nx \\cdot n + y \\cdot (n + 1) = 546\n\\]\nwhere \\( x \\) is the number of terms equal to \\( n \\) and \\( y \\) is the number of terms equal to \\( n + 1 \\). Since \\( x + y = 73 \\), we can substitute \\( y = 73 - x \\).\n\nStep 4: Substituting \\( y \\) into the equation gives:\n\\[\nx \\cdot n + (73 - x) \\cdot (n + 1) = 546\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\nx \\cdot n + 73n + 73 - x \\cdot n - 73 = 546\n\\]\nThis reduces to:\n\\[\n73n = 546\n\\]\nThus, we find:\n\\[\nn = \\frac{546}{73} = 7 \\quad \\text{(with a remainder of 35)}\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Since \\( n = 7 \\), we have \\( 8 \\) must take on \\( 35 \\) of the values, meaning \\( 8 \\) appears \\( 35 \\) times and \\( 7 \\) appears \\( 38 \\) times.\n\nStep 6: The first term of the sequence that equals \\( 8 \\) is \\( \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\right\\rfloor \\). This implies:\n\\[\n8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01\n\\]\nFrom this, we can derive:\n\\[\n8 - \\frac{57}{100} \\leq r < 8.01 - \\frac{57}{100}\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\frac{743}{100} \\leq r < \\frac{744}{100}\n\\]\n\nStep 7: Multiplying through by 100 gives:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744\n\\]\nThus, we conclude:\n\\[\n\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.

The base case is trivial. Inductive case: when n is 0 it is also trivial. When $n>0$, let $m=2^n$, and we have $3^m - 1 \\equiv 4*m \\pmod{8*m}$. Then there is $k$ where $3^m - 1 = (8*m)*k + 4*m$. Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$ Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \\equiv 8*m \\pmod{16*m}$. Therefore the inductive case holds.

(For real $x^{}_{}$, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the [[floor function|greatest integer]] less than or equal to $x^{}_{}$.) Show that it is 743.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: We start with the equation given in the problem, which states that the sum of the floor functions from \\( \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{19}{100} \\right\\rfloor \\) to \\( \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{91}{100} \\right\\rfloor \\) equals 546. There are \\( 91 - 19 + 1 = 73 \\) terms in this sum.\n\nStep 2: Since the floor function can only change by at most 1 as \\( k \\) varies from 19 to 91, the values of \\( \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{k}{100} \\right\\rfloor \\) can only be either \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\) or \\( \\lfloor r \\rfloor + 1 \\).\n\nStep 3: Let \\( n = \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\). Then, we can express the sum as:\n\\[\nx \\cdot n + y \\cdot (n + 1) = 546\n\\]\nwhere \\( x \\) is the number of terms equal to \\( n \\) and \\( y \\) is the number of terms equal to \\( n + 1 \\). Since \\( x + y = 73 \\), we can substitute \\( y = 73 - x \\).\n\nStep 4: Substituting \\( y \\) into the equation gives:\n\\[\nx \\cdot n + (73 - x) \\cdot (n + 1) = 546\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\nx \\cdot n + 73n + 73 - x \\cdot n - 73 = 546\n\\]\nThis reduces to:\n\\[\n73n = 546\n\\]\nThus, we find:\n\\[\nn = \\frac{546}{73} = 7 \\quad \\text{(with a remainder of 35)}\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Since \\( n = 7 \\), we have \\( 8 \\) must take on \\( 35 \\) of the values, meaning \\( 8 \\) appears \\( 35 \\) times and \\( 7 \\) appears \\( 38 \\) times.\n\nStep 6: The first term of the sequence that equals \\( 8 \\) is \\( \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{57}{100} \\right\\rfloor \\). This implies:\n\\[\n8 \\leq r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01\n\\]\nFrom this, we can derive:\n\\[\n8 - \\frac{57}{100} \\leq r < 8.01 - \\frac{57}{100}\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\frac{743}{100} \\leq r < \\frac{744}{100}\n\\]\n\nStep 7: Multiplying through by 100 gives:\n\\[\n743 \\leq 100r < 744\n\\]\nThus, we conclude:\n\\[\n\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743\n\\]\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem aime_1991_p6:\n  fixes r :: real\n  assumes \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in>{19::nat..<92}.
