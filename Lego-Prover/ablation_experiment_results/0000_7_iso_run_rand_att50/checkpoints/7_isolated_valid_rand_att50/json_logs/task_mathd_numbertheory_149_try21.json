If their teacher puts them in groups of 8, the last group has 5 students. If their teacher instead puts them in groups of 6, the last group has 3 students. What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nWe are given that $N\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $N\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$.  We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer.

If their teacher puts them in groups of 8, the last group has 5 students. If their teacher instead puts them in groups of 6, the last group has 3 students. What is the sum of all possible values of $N$? Show that it is 66.\n\n## Informal proof\nStep 1: We start with the congruences given in the problem: \\( N \\equiv 5 \\mod 8 \\) and \\( N \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\).\n\nStep 2: From the first congruence, we can express \\( N \\) in the form:\n\\[\nN = 8k + 5\n\\]\nfor some integer \\( k \\).\n\nStep 3: Substitute this expression into the second congruence:\n\\[\n8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6\n\\]\nwhich further simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k \\equiv -2 \\mod 6 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 2k \\equiv 4 \\mod 6\n\\]\nDividing through by 2 (noting that 2 and 6 are coprime), we get:\n\\[\nk \\equiv 2 \\mod 3\n\\]\n\nStep 4: This means \\( k \\) can be expressed as:\n\\[\nk = 3m + 2\n\\]\nfor some integer \\( m \\).\n\nStep 5: Substitute back into the expression for \\( N \\):\n\\[\nN = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Now we need to find values of \\( N \\) such that \\( N < 50 \\):\n\\[\n24m + 21 < 50 \\implies 24m < 29 \\implies m < \\frac{29}{24} \\implies m = 0\n\\]\nor \\( m = 1 \\).\n\nStep 7: Calculate the possible values of \\( N \\):\n- For \\( m = 0 \\): \\( N = 21 \\)\n- For \\( m = 1 \\): \\( N = 45 \\)\n\nStep 8: The possible values of \\( N \\) are 21 and 45. Their sum is:\n\\[\n21 + 45 = 66\n\\]\n\nStep 9: Conclude that the sum of all possible values of \\( N \\) is 66.\n\n## Formal statement\n```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\n```\n\n## Proof", "action_agent_ai0": "```isabelle\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_149:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k\\<in> {x::nat. x<50 \\<and> x mod 8 =5 \\<and> x mod 6=3}. k) = 66\"\nproof -\n  (* Step 1: We start with the congruences given in the problem: \\( N \\equiv 5 \\mod 8 \\) and \\( N \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\). *)\n  \n  (* Define the set of all possible values of N that satisfy the given conditions. *)\n  let ?S = \"{x::nat. x < 50 \\<and> x mod 8 = 5 \\<and> x mod 6 = 3}\"\n\n  (* Step 2: From the first congruence, we can express \\( N \\) in the form: \\( N = 8k + 5 \\) for some integer \\( k \\). *)\n  have \"k = (N - 5) div 8\" for N\n    using nat_div_mod_eq by blast\n\n  (* Step 3: Substitute this expression into the second congruence: \\( 8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\). *)\n  have \"8k + 5 mod 6 = 3\" \n    (* Simplifying \\( 8 \\mod 6 = 2 \\), we get \\( 2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\). *)\n    unfolding mod_eq_iff by (simp add: mod_eq_iff)\n\n  (* This simplifies to: \\( 2k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\). *)\n  have \"2k + 5 \u2261 3 mod 6\" by auto\n\n  (* This further simplifies to: \\( 2k \u2261 -2 \\mod 6 \\) or \\( 2k \u2261 4 \\mod 6 \\). *)\n  have \"2k \u2261 4 mod 6\" by (metis add_equiv_mod)\n\n  (* Step 4: Dividing through by 2, we get: \\( k \u2261 2 \\mod 3 \\). *)\n  have \"k mod 3 = 2\" by (metis coprime_cancel)\n\n  (* Step 5: This means \\( k \\) can be expressed as \\( k = 3m + 2 \\) for some integer \\( m \\). *)\n  have \"k = 3m + 2\" for m :: nat\n\n  (* Step 6: Substitute back into the expression for \\( N \\): \\( N = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21 \\). *)\n  have \"N = 24m + 21\" for m :: nat\n\n  (* Step 7: Now we need to find values of \\( N \\) such that \\( N < 50 \\): \\( 24m + 21 < 50 \\). *)\n  have \"24m + 21 < 50 \\<longleftrightarrow> 24m < 29 \\<longleftrightarrow> m < 29 / 24\" by simp\n\n  (* This implies \\( m = 0 \\) or \\( m = 1 \\). *)\n  have \"m = 0 \\<or> m = 1\" by (metis less_eq_nat_def)\n\n  (* Step 8: Calculate the possible values of \\( N \\): *)\n  have \"N = 21\" if \"m = 0\" for m::nat\n    using that by simp\n  have \"N = 45\" if \"m = 1\" for m::nat\n    using that by simp\n\n  (* Step 9: The possible values of \\( N \\) are 21 and 45.
