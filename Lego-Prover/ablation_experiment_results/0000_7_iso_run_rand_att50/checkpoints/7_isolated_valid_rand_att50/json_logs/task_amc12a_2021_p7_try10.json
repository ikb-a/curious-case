This gives us:\n\\[\n(xy - 1)^2 + (x + y)^2 = (x^2y^2 - 2xy + 1) + (x^2 + 2xy + y^2) = x^2 + y^2 + x^2y^2 + 1.\n\\]\n\nStep 2: Recognize that \\(x^2\\) and \\(y^2\\) are non-negative, as they are squares of real numbers. Therefore, the minimum value of \\(x^2 + y^2\\) is \\(0\\).\n\nStep 3: The term \\(x^2y^2\\) is also non-negative, as it is the product of squares. Thus, the minimum value of \\(x^2y^2\\) is \\(0\\).\n\nStep 4: Combine the results from Steps 2 and 3. The minimum value of the entire expression is:\n\\[\n0 + 0 + 1 = 1.\n\\]\n\nStep 5: To achieve this minimum value, set \\(x = 0\\) and \\(y = 0\\).
