theorem
  fixes x::real
  assumes "0<x" "x<pi"
  shows "12 \<le> ((9 * (x^2 * (sin x)^2)) + 4) / (x * sin x)"
proof -
  (* Let $y = x \sin x$. *)
  define y where "y=x * sin x"
  (* It suffices to show that $12 \leq \frac{9y^2 + 4}{y}. *)
  have "12 \<le> (9 * y^2 + 4) / y"
  proof -
    (* It is trivial to see that $y > 0$. *)
    have c0: "y > 0"
      sledgehammer
    (* Then one can multiply both sides by $y$ and it suffices to show $12y \leq 9y^2 + 4$. *)
    have "(9 * y^2 + 4) \<ge> 12 * y"
