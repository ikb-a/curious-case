theorem mathd_algebra_109_evolved:
  fixes a b :: real
  assumes h0 : "3*a + 2*b = 12"
    and h1 : "a = 4"
  shows "b = 0"
proof -
  have "3 * a + 2 * b = 12" using h0 by simp
  have "3 * 4 + 2 * b = 12" using h1 by (metis h0)
  have "12 + 2 * b = 12" by (smt (verit) \<open>3 * 4 + 2 * b = 12\<close>)
  then have "2 * b = 0" by (simp add: add_diff_eq)
  thus "b = 0" by simp
