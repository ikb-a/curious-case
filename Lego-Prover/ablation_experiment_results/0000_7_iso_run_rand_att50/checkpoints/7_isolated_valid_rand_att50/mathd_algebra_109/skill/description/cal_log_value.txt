This skill calculates the value of a number given its logarithm. It is a general mathematical property and can be used in any context where logarithms are involved. The skill takes four arguments: two real numbers 'a' and 'b' which are greater than 0 and 'a' is not equal to 1, and a real number 'c' which is the logarithm base 'a' of 'b'. It returns the value of 'b', which is equal to 'a' raised to the power 'c'.
