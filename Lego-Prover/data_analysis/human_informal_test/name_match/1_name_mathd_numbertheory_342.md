## Usage 1 of 1:
### Problem:
Task name: `mathd_numbertheory_247.json`

Solve the congruence $3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}$, as a residue modulo 11.  (Give an answer between 0 and 10.) Show that it is 8.
### Informal Proof:
Note that $2 \equiv -9 \pmod{11}$, so we can write the given congruence as $3n \equiv -9 \pmod{11}$.  Since 3 is relatively prime to 11, we can divide both sides by 3, to get $n \equiv -3 \equiv 8 \pmod{11}$.
### Solution:

## Problems
Suppose that $n$ is a positive integer for which the sum of all positive integers less than $n$ that are relatively prime to $n$ is equal to $n/2$. Show that $n$ is divisible by 3.

## Informal proof
Step 1: The sum of all positive integers less than $n$ that are relatively prime to $n$ is the sum of all positive integers from 1 to $n-1$ excluding those that are not relatively prime to $n$.
Step 2: The sum of all positive integers from 1 to $n-1$ can be expressed as $\frac{(n-1)(n)}{2}$.
Step 3: We can rewrite the sum of all positive integers less than $n$ that are relatively prime to $n$ as $\frac{(n-1)(n)}{2} - P$, where $P$ is the sum of all positive integers less than $n$ that are not relatively prime to $n$.
Step 4: $P$ is equal to the sum of all positive integers less than $n$ that are divisible by 2 or 3. We need to show that $P$ is divisible by 3.
Step 5: We can express $P$ as the sum of two sums: $P = P_2 + P_3$, where $P_2$ is the sum of all positive integers less than $n$ that are divisible by 2, and $P_3$ is the sum of all positive integers less than $n$ that are divisible by 3.
Step 6: We can express $P_3$ as the sum of all positive integers less than $n$ that are divisible by 3. Since $P_3$ is divisible by 3, $P$ is also divisible by 3.
Step 7: Since the sum of all positive integers less than $n$ that are relatively prime to $n$ is equal to $n/2$, we have $\frac{(n-1)(n)}{2} - P = \frac{n}{2}$.
Step 8: Substituting the value of $P$ in the equation above, we get $\frac{(n-1)(n)}{2} - P_2 - P_3 = \frac{n}{2}$.
Step 9: Since $P$ is divisible by 3, $P_2 - P_3$ must also be divisible by 3.
Step 10: Since $P_2$ and $P_3$ are both non-negative integers, $P_2 - P_3$ must be a non-negative integer divisible by 3.
Step 11: The only non-negative integer divisible by 3 is 0. Therefore, $P_2 - P_3 = 0$.
Step 12: This implies that $P_2 = P_3$.
Step 13: Since $P_2$ is the sum of all positive integers less than $n$ that are divisible by 2, and $P_3$ is the sum of all positive integers less than $n$ that are divisible by 3, this implies that the number of positive integers less than $n$ that are divisible by 2 is equal to the number of positive integers less than $n$ that are divisible by 3.
Step 14: This can only happen if $n$ is divisible by both 2 and 3.
Step 15: Since $n$ is a positive integer, it must be divisible by 6, and therefore divisible by 3.

## Problems
Suppose that $a$ and $b$ are positive integers for which $ab + 1$ divides $a^2 + b^2$. Show that $\frac{a^2+b^2}{ab+1}$ is the square of an integer.

## Informal proof
Step 1: Express $a^2 + b^2$ as $(ab+1)q$ for some positive integer q.
Step 2: Rearrange the equation to get $a^2 - abq + b^2 - q = 0$.
Step 3: Treat $a$ as a variable and view the equation as a quadratic equation in $a$.
Step 4: Use the quadratic formula to find the roots of the equation, which are given by $a = \frac{bq \pm \sqrt{q^2 - 4(b^2 - q)}}{2}$.
Step 5: To prove that $\frac{a^2+b^2}{ab+1}$ is the square of an integer, we need to show that $q^2 - 4(b^2 - q)$ is a perfect square.
Step 6: Rearrange the equation to get $q^2 - 4b^2 + 4q = m^2$ for some positive integer m.
Step 7: Rewrite the equation as $(2q + m)^2 - 4b^2 = m^2$.
Step 8: Simplify the equation to get $(2q + m)^2 - (2b)^2 = m^2$.
Step 9: Use the difference of squares identity to rewrite the equation as $(2q + m + 2b)(2q + m - 2b) = m^2$.
Step 10: Since $q$ and $m$ are positive integers, we have $(2q + m + 2b) > (2q + m - 2b)$.
Step 11: Therefore, $(2q + m + 2b)$ must be a perfect square, and $\frac{a^2+b^2}{ab+1}$ is the square of an integer.

## Problems
Suppose that $x$ and $y$ are real numbers such that $x^2 - 2xy + 6x + y^2 - 7y + 6 = 0$.  What is $x + y$?  $ \mathrm{(A) \ } 0 \qquad \mathrm{(B) \ } 1 \qquad \mathrm{(C) \ } 2 \qquad \mathrm{(D) \ } 3 \qquad \mathrm{(E) \ } 4 $

## Informal proof
Step 1: Rearrange the equation to get $(x - y)^2 + 6(x - y) = 1$.
Step 2: Factor the equation to get $(x - y)(x - y + 6) = 1$.
Step 3: Since 1 is a prime number, the only possible values for $(x - y)$ are 1 and -1.
Step 4: If $(x - y) = 1$, then $(x - y + 6) = 7$.
Step 5: If $(x - y) = -1$, then $(x - y + 6) = 5$.
Step 6: Since we are looking for the value of $(x + y)$, we add the possible values of $(x - y)$ to get $(x + y) = 1 + 7 = 8$ or $(x + y) = -1 + 5 = 4$.
Step 7: Therefore, the possible values of $(x + y)$ are 8 and 4.

## Problems
What is the largest integer that divides all integers of the form $n^5 - n$, where n is a positive integer?

## Informal proof
Step 1: Factor the expression $n^5 - n$ to get $n(n-1)(n+1)(n^2+1)$.
Step 2: Note that for any positive integer $n$, $n(n-1)(n+1)$ is always divisible by 6, since one of $n$, $(n-1)$, or $(n+1)$ must be divisible by 2, and one of them must be divisible by 3.
Step 3: To show that $n(n-1)(n+1)(n^2+1)$ is divisible by 30, we need to show that it is divisible by both 6 and 5.
Step 4: Since $n(n-1)(n+1)$ is divisible by 6, we only need to show that $n(n-1)(n+1)(n^2+1)$ is divisible by 5.
Step 5: If $n$ is divisible by 5, then $n(n-1)(n+1)(n^2+1)$ is clearly divisible by 5.
Step 6: If $n$ is not divisible by 5, then $n^5$ is congruent to $n$ modulo 5, and $n^5 - n$ is divisible by 5.
Step 7: Therefore, the largest integer that divides all integers of the form $n^5 - n$ is 30.

## Problems
Suppose that $x$ and $y$ are positive integers for which $x^2 - y^2 = 19$. What is $x$?

## Informal proof
Step 1: Factor the expression $x^2 - y^2$ to get $(x - y)(x + y) = 19$.
Step 2: Since the product of two positive integers is equal to 19, the possible values for $(x - y)$ and $(x + y)$ are (1, 19) or (19, 1).
Step 3: Solving the equations $x - y = 1$ and $x + y = 19$, we get $x = \frac{20}{2} = 10$.
Step 4: Solving the equations $x - y = 19$ and $x + y = 1$, we get $x = \frac{20}{2} = 10$.
Step 5: Therefore, the value of $x$ is 10.

## Formal statement

## Problems
For positive integers $a$ and $b$ such that $a^2 - b^2 = 19$ and $a > b$, what is the value of $a$?

## Informal proof
Step 1: Factor the expression $a^2 - b^2$ to get $(a - b)(a + b) = 19$.
Step 2: Since 19 is a prime number, the possible values for $(a - b)$ and $(a + b)$ are (1, 19) or (19, 1).
Step 3: Solving the equations $a - b = 1$ and $a + b = 19$, we get $a = \frac{20}{2} = 10$.
Step 4: Therefore, the value of $a$ is 10.

## Problems
Suppose that $x$ and $y$ are real numbers such that $\frac{x}{y} + \frac{y}{x} = 2$. What is $\frac{x^7}{y^7} + \frac{y^7}{x^7}$?

## Informal proof
Step 1: Square the equation $\frac{x}{y} + \frac{y}{x} = 2$ to get $\frac{x^2}{y^2} + 2 + \frac{y^2}{x^2} = 4$.
Step 2: Rearrange the equation to get $\frac{x^2}{y^2} + \frac{y^2}{x^2} = 2$.
Step 3: Cube the equation $\frac{x^2}{y^2} + \frac{y^2}{x^2} = 2$ to get $\frac{x^6}{y^6} + 3\left(\frac{x^2}{y^2} + \frac{y^2}{x^2}\right) + \frac{y^6}{x^6} = 8$.
Step 4: Substitute the value of $\frac{x^2}{y^2} + \frac{y^2}{x^2}$ from Step 2 into the equation in Step 3 to get $\frac{x^6}{y^6} + 6 + \frac{y^6}{x^6} = 8$.
Step 5: Rearrange the equation to get $\frac{x^6}{y^6} + \frac{y^6}{x^6} = 2$.
Step 6: Multiply the equation $\frac{x^6}{y^6} + \frac{y^6}{x^6} = 2$ by $\frac{x}{y} + \frac{y}{x}$ to get $\frac{x^7}{y^7} + \frac{y^7}{x^7} + 2 = 4$.
Step 7: Rearrange the equation to get $\frac{x^7}{y^7} + \frac{y^7}{x^7} = 2$.
Step 8: Therefore, $\frac{x^7}{y^7} + \frac{y^7}{x^7} = 2$.
