### Problem:
Task name: `mathd_numbertheory_466.json`

What is the remainder when $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \dots + 9 + 10$ is divided by 9? Show that it is 1.
### Informal Proof:
The sum of the first n natural numbers can be calculated using the formula $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. This formula is derived by pairing terms from the beginning and end of the sequence. For example, in the sequence 1, 2, ..., n, the first term (1) and the last term (n) sum to n+1. The second term (2) and the second-to-last term (n-1) also sum to n+1, and so on. This pairing process creates $\frac{n}{2}$ pairs, each summing to n+1, so the total sum is $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.  Using this formula, the sum of the first 10 natural numbers is $\frac{10(10+1)}{2} = 55$. To find the remainder when 55 is divided by 9, we can use the division algorithm, which states that for any integers a and b, with b > 0, there exist unique integers q and r such that a = bq + r and 0 â‰¤ r < b. In this case, a = 55 and b = 9. We find that q = 6 and r = 1, so 55 = 9*6 + 1, and the remainder is 1. Therefore, the remainder when $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \dots + 9 + 10$ is divided by 9 is 1.
