## Usage 1 of 1:
### Problem:
Task name: `mathd_algebra_77.json`

Suppose that $a$ and $b$ are nonzero real numbers, and that the equation  $${x^2 + ax + b = 0}$$ has solutions $a$ and $b$. Then what is the pair $(a,b)$? Show that it is (1,-2).
### Informal Proof:
1. Set up the equations from the properties of the roots of the quadratic equation:    a. $a + b = -a$    b. $ab = b$  2. Solve the system of equations:    a. Solve equation 1 for $b$: $b = -2a$.    b. Substitute the expression for $b$ from step 2a into equation 2: $a(-2a) = -2a$.    c. Simplify the equation from step 2b: $-2a^2 = -2a$.    d. Divide both sides of the equation from step 2c by $-2a$ (since $a \neq 0$): $a = 1$.    e. Substitute the value of $a$ from step 2d back into the expression for $b$ from step 2a: $b = -2(1) = -2$.  3. Conclusion: The pair $(a, b)$ is indeed $(1, -2)$.
### Solution:
