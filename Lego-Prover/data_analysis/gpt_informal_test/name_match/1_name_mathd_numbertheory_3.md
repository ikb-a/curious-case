## Usage 1 of 1:
### Problem:
Task name: `mathd_numbertheory_343.json`

What is the units digit of the product of all of the odd integers between 0 and 12? Show that it is 5.
### Informal Proof:
Let $S$ be the set of odd integers between 0 and 12, i.e., $S = \{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11\}$. We want to find the units digit of the product of all elements in $S$. Instead of calculating the entire product, we focus on the units digits of the elements in $S$ and their product. The units digits of the elements in $S$ are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 1 (for 11). The product of these units digits is 1 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 9 * 1 = 945. The units digit of this product is 5, which is the remainder when 945 is divided by 10. Therefore, the units digit of the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12 is 5.
### Solution:
```isabelle
theorem mathd_numbertheory_343 :
  "(\<Prod> k < 6. (2 * k + 1)) mod 10 = (5::nat)"
```
